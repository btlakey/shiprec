I've even given it as a gift half a dozen times or so. Useless. They all whine it’s too hard to follow with the classical references, obscure poetry, and French quotes. I say the story stands on its own without the reader being as well-read as dear Dorothy. Or you could look it up and learn something. They groan. Lazy readers.<br /><br />So I've either just given the least persuasive book review ever or I've challenged you. It makes no difference to me. I've stopped recommending it. It's one of my very favorite books and if you never read it that’s fine. I'll just go in the other room and laugh to myself about Mungo’s pig. When you follow and ask what I’m laughing about I’ll say “Oh nothing. You wouldn’t understand.”<br />\",\n",

       "   'text': '<b>“I despised men who accepted their fate. I shaped mine twenty times and had it broken twenty times in my hands.”</b><br><br>Bold words from a bold man. <br><br>Francis Crawford of Lymond has been accused of the most nefarious things: deceit, treachery, rape, drunkenness, murder,and just so he will for sure hang...treason. He has the same problem as Prince Harry of Wales does today. He is the spare son, the second son. The one that will have to make his own way while the grand Crawford estate goes to his older brother Richard. <br><br><a href=\"https://s1183.photobucket.com/user/jkeeten/media/DumbartonCastle_zps795ef1d6.jpg.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">\\n  <img src=\"https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/hostedimages/1535823356i/26236244.jpg\" alt=\" photo DumbartonCastle_zps795ef1d6.jpg\" class=\"gr-hostedUserImg\" loading=\"lazy\">\\n</a><br><b>Dumbarton Castle, Scotland</b><br><br>Women are swept up under the sway of his seductive powers. Men want to be him or kill him. He makes it impossible for anyone to remain neutral in their regard for him. His tongue is as sharp as a rapier and his reticence about not sharing plans has even his most stout allies tearing their hair out in frustration. He is an accomplished polyglot and a master of disguise. He is a force of nature creating havoc for the ever shifting alliances between the Scots and the English. He does not join a side, does not trust any organization enough to actually call himself a member (nice to know I’m not the only one with this affliction). In 1547 Scotland he is a Renaissance Man and that does create it’s own problems. <br><br><i>”Versatility is one of the few human traits which are universally intolerable. You may be good at Greek and good at painting and be popular. You may be good at Greek and good at sport, and be wildly popular. But try all three and you’re a mountebank, Nothing arouses suspicion quicker than genuine, all-round proficiency.”</i><br><br>When his sister-in-law first meets Lymond, under rather awkward circumstances. He was looting her house of silver at the time. She can tell this brother has different stripes than her husband. <br><br><i>So this was Richard’s brother. Every line of him spoke, palimpsestwise, with two voices. The clothes, black and rich, were vaguely slovenly; the skin sun-glazed and cracked; the fine eyes slackly lidded; the mouth insolent and self-indulgent. He returned the scrutiny without rancour. <br>“What had you expected? A viper, or a devil, or a ravening idiot; Milo with the ox on his shoulders, Angra-Mainyo prepared to do battle with Zoroaster, or the Golden Ass? OR didn’t you know the family colouring? Richard hasn’t got it.

Throughout the book Dunnett shows her range of reading and her understanding of classical literature. <br><br><i>”Look what we’ve got! Orpheus wriggling rump first out of Hades with his chivalry ashine like a ten-thread twill.”</i><br><br><a href=\"https://s1183.photobucket.com/user/jkeeten/media/Orpheus_zpse87e9bd8.jpg.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">\\n  <img src=\"https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/hostedimages/1535823356i/26236241._SY540_.jpg\" alt=\" photo Orpheus_zpse87e9bd8.jpg\" class=\"gr-hostedUserImg\" loading=\"lazy\">\\n</a><br><br>It could make a reader (ME!!!) feel self-conscious about my own inadequate reading resume. <br><br>One of my favorite characters was a blind woman named Lady Christian Stewart who despite her affliction is brave and brilliant proving more than a match for Lymond in a battle of wits. <br><br><i>”To be sure,” said Christian serenely. “And painting with breath is my stock-in-trade--you’d forgotten that, hadn’t you? I’m an architect in lexicography; I can build you a palace of adverbs and a hermitage of personal pronouns...”</i><br><br>As the plot slithers around and the mystery surrounding Lymond’s innocence or guilt becomes more convoluted, key characters die at untimely moments, and shifting alliance change people’s perspective of events. The tension mounts as we are driven towards a final showdown between brothers, and a game of cards determines whether Lymond will swing or be welcomed back into the arms of his family. <br><a href=\"https://s1183.photobucket.com/user/jkeeten/media/Hangmansknot_zpsf2d23752.jpg.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">\\n  <img src=\"https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/hostedimages/1535823356i/26236242.jpg\" alt=\" photo Hangmansknot_zpsf2d23752.jpg\" class=\"gr-hostedUserImg\" loading=\"lazy\">\\n</a><br>The book is set against the backdrop of an English invasion of Scotland with Mary Queen of Scots a mere tot and incapable of providing commanding leadership. Men like Lymond have to stand up and do more than their share to insure that there remains a kingdom to be commanded. Dunnett deftly weaves fictional characters in with real life personages giving us an authentic feel for this turbulent time in Scottish History. In the next book in the series Lymond follows Mary Queen of Scots to France to insure her safety. I wouldn’t miss it for anything.<br><br>If you wish to see more of my most recent book and movie reviews, visit <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" href=\"http://www.jeffreykeeten.com\">http://www.jeffreykeeten.com</a><br>I also have a Facebook blogger page at:<a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" href=\"https://www.facebook.com/JeffreyKeeten\">https://www.facebook.com/JeffreyKeeten</a>',\n",

       "   'text': '<b>2023</b>: It held up on reread, so that’s a relief. Actually more fun this time around.<br>———<br><b>2022</b>: Well then. I must say Dorothy Dunnett has <s>Dunnett</s> done it. “It” being a seemingly impossible feat of taking a book that I was physically restraining myself from throwing at the wall for the first 70 pages or so and making me love it by the end. <br><br>At the beginning I was reduced to angrily typing this* as I was seething from not understanding any accolades this book received from all my bookish friends:<br><blockquote>\\n<i>* “I wish to God,” said Gideon, with mild exasperation, “that you’d talk – just once – in prose like other people.”</i><br><br>Yeah, me too. I wish this book had been written in normal prose, like other authors manage. But apparently both me and Dorothy Dunnett eschew the knowledge that “Brevity is the soul of wit” because why use one word where an ornamental sentence containing a bit of an obscure medieval poetry reference (in French, probably) would do? And so we split into two warring camps here - (1) those who bask in the richness of the language and multilayered complexity of the story and (2) those who view this book as a bramble thicket of overwritten metaphors that grind repartees and battles to eyes-glazing-over stupor.</blockquote><br><b>Yeah, foolish Nataliya from a couple of weeks ago, I laugh at your frustrated naïveté</b>. But in my defense, Dunnett came up with sentences like this: <i>“Dumbness, flowing among them uncovered like a crocus in the snow the lost reprise of a hornpipe, pursuing its scratchy but dogged course in the musicians’ gallery.”</i> Or like this: <i>“The luminous eyes, apparently satisfied with their diet, released their grip.”</i><br><br>So can you blame me for that initial lapse in judgment? Lymond himself would agree, I’m sure.<br>————<br><blockquote> <img src=\"https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/hostedimages/1641281352i/32402413._SX540_.jpg\" width=\"400\" class=\"gr-hostedUserImg\" loading=\"lazy\"><br>(Whoever was responsible for those book covers that make this novel look like a cheap bodice-ripper should be hanged. Or quartered. Or both.)</blockquote><br>This book is a historical mystery of sorts, <b>slowly revealing to us the gradual redemption of what initially seems the most irredeemable character</b>. Francis Crawford of Lymond, he of the <i>“cornflower-blue”</i> eyes and a sharp tongue that never stops talking. A traitor and pariah who does not stoop at double-crossing, lying, corruption and even setting fire to his ancestral home while his own mother is inside. Or did it really happen this way? Dunnett will have you find out, slowly, deliberately, while only showing you Lymond through others’s eyes, making you infer his motivations from his actions while he is frustratingly opaque about them, while he plays a masterful chess game of politics too complicated to understand for the longest time, and all while he’s being rude and obnoxious in his obscure quotes-filled excessively erudite speech*.<br><blockquote>* <i>“I am a narwhal looking for my virgin. I have sucked up the sea like Charybdis and failing other entertainment will spew it three times daily, for a fee.”</i><br><br>See what I mean? It’s like he’s trying to drive you insane. And yes, that’s on purpose.</blockquote><br>And yet slowly, slowly the metaphorical layers are peeled off and you realize that not only have you, like pretty much everyone who spends more than five minutes in Lymond’s company, have fallen under the spell of his charisma but that so many things you assumed are wrong. <b>And by the time he starts speaking like less of a prick and more like the Renaissance man he is (seriously, there’s not a subject at which our Francis doesn’t fully excel at) you realize that he actually has quite a few interesting things to say</b> — culminating in that wonderful “patriotism sucks” (paraphrasing here, as you may gather) speech at the end. <br><blockquote>\\n<i> “That,” said Henry Lauder, closing his spectacles and throwing his pen in the wastepaper basket, “is a brain. If I were ten years younger and a lassie, I’d woo him myself.”</i><br><br>Don’t we all, Mr. Lauder, don’t we all. Get in line, and that line is long.</blockquote><br>————<br><blockquote> <img src=\"https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/hostedimages/1641281352i/32402414._SX540_.jpg\" width=\"400\" class=\"gr-hostedUserImg\" loading=\"lazy\">\\n</blockquote><br><br>This story is set during the “Rough Wooing” time in the 16th century, after English King Henry VIII died and the plans were concocted to annex Scotland by marrying the orphaned toddler Queen Mary to Henry’s young son, with Scotland pulled into different directions by England and France, and endless armed conflicts and squirmishes between the English and the Scots became the norm. And here’s the thing — <b>Dorothy Dunnett expect the readers to come to this story already reasonably versed in the history of that time</b>. I lucked out having recently read <a href=\"https://goodreads.com/book/show/10097.Queen_of_Scots_The_True_Life_of_Mary_Stuart\" title=\"Queen of Scots The True Life of Mary Stuart by John Guy\" rel=\"noopener\">Queen of Scots: The True Life of Mary Stuart</a>, but at the very least a through Wikipedia perusal may be quite helpful. Otherwise you just may get lost in the sea of characters and references and events, and your enjoyment will suffer quite a bit.<br><br>————<br><blockquote> <img src=\"https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/hostedimages/1641281352i/32402415._SX540_.jpg\" width=\"400\" class=\"gr-hostedUserImg\" loading=\"lazy\">\\n</blockquote><br><b>Dunnett is a absolute master at characterization</b>. Her characters are so alive, they almost walk off the page — Lymond himself, his mother Sybilla, Gideon and Kate Somerville, Christian Stewart, Tom Erskine, Wat Buccleuch — you guys are all invited to dinner at my place. And even the infuriating ones gradually acquire surprising depths (looking at you, Richard of the grey eyeballs!), and get a bit of a redemption for foolish foolhardy choices (Will Scott, something tells me you will need your hand held for a few more years in life), and a gentle lessons in the simple truths of life and marriage (Mariotta, you stupid shallow girl). They all are vivid and vibrant — but even supporting characters who are only on-page briefly still are memorable.<br><blockquote>\\n  <i> “So she was on her own, Kate thought, and instilled all the friendly helpfulness she could into her next question. “Excuse me, but are you the bad company young Mr. Scott has got into?” </i>\\n</blockquote><br>————<br><br>It’s not an easy book. It requires focus and often a quick history refresher, and a passing knowledge of French and some Latin (or patience with online translator), and a tolerance for the words “cornflower-blue”, and acceptance of the fact that Dorothy Dunnett and her character Francis Crawford of a Lymond are likely much erudite than any one of us. <br><br><b>But it’s worth the effort and the patience and a few hairs pulled out in frustration.</b><br><blockquote>\\n  <i> “I wish to God,” said Gideon, with mild exasperation, “that you’d talk – just once – in prose like other people.”</i>\\n</blockquote><br>4.5 stars.<br>————<br><br>Thank you to my wonderful buddy readers Jennifer and Stephen!<br><br>And special thanks to Nastya, the memory of whose enthusiastic love for this book (and encouraging comments) helped me get through that rough beginning of Lymond being an absolute jerk and the language being a thicket of impenetrable density. Yeah, I’m a fan now.<br><br>————<br>And for a bit of fun for those who have read this book, here’s a condensed version of it in the “Movies in 15 Minutes” style: <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" href=\"https://archiveofourown.org/works/3146252\">https://archiveofourown.org/works/314...</a><br><br>——————<br>Also posted on <a href=\"https://nataliyabookblog.wordpress.com/2022/01/12/the-game-of-kings-by-dorothy-dunnett/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">my blog</a>.',\n",

       "   'text': 'This is going to be my last and final review of Lymond. And I have a confession to make: I no longer like it.<br /><br />Yes, I\\'m prepared for the public stoning and the flood of \"unlikes.\"<br /><br />But I don\\'t want to pretend I am still onboard this long-ago sunk ship and leave my old ratings keep that impression alive. The truth is, I\\'ve reread Lymond several times I didn\\'t even keep track of them all, and with each reread I liked it less and less. And less, and less . . . My GR records only register four rereads, but there were more, the last one was on my own and alone in 2020 during the Covid-19 pandemic and I didn\\'t register it on here. That reread showed me that I had ceased being a fan.<br /><br />I\\'ve had issues with Lymond since my first read, particularly with book 1 and book 6, but they started to grow from my second reread on, when I simply couldn\\'t overlook the mounting problems and decided to never reread the last book again. I kept to that until my last reread, when I reread bits and pieces of \"Checkmate,\" and that was probably the killing blow for any remnants of love left for the series. I did discuss it at length with one of my best friends, and I think that should\\'ve been the closure.<br /><br />I don\\'t know if I\\'m the only one, but I don\\'t know anyone else who has become this disenchanted to the point of stopped being a fan of Dorothy Dunnett. It\\'s a bit awkward to be an outlier, and I have tried to discuss my issues before, many times. I thought I would give it another try this April 2023 in a reread with a group of friends<b>*</b>; maybe there\\'d be some positive change this time, I thought, and . . . <br /><br />Part I of \"A Game of Kings\" is how long I lasted until I became exhausted and decided it wasn\\'t worth it trying to resurrect the dead. What is gone is gone and won\\'t be back. I\\'ve come to terms with that.<br /><br />So, with that context, here\\'s my updated review stating my reasons (most but not all, or it\\'d be even longer). There be spoilers, beware.<br /><br /><b>THE REVIEW:</b><br /><br />I’ve never liked those books—and TV shows—in which the writers felt that the readers need to have it all spelt out for them for a variety of reasons, mainly the assumption that they will miss it otherwise.<br /><br />And then I found Dorothy Dunnett and met the other extreme of the “dumbing it down for the masses” spectrum. That I didn’t like it either is evident, but my issue isn’t that she employs language that most of humanity won’t get. It’s what it does to the narrative.<br /><br />I won’t include here a summary of the plot, there are excellent reviews out there that have done it better than I could; instead I’ll talk about my own impressions, and so I’ll go point by point.<br /><br />THE PLOT: The story starts interestingly enough, wrenching some laughter from the readers via Lymond’s comical initial antics, and keeping the interest till the middle with a rapid succession of swashbuckling adventures that makes the delight of those of us that grew up crushing hard on d’Artagnan, Edmond Dantès, and Percy Blakeney. <br /><br />You begin to see in Francis Crawford of Lymond another potential classic hero to love. You start to make conjectures about the genesis of his mystifying feud with his elder brother, you mull earnestly over your own hypotheses that would explain things ranging from why he doesn’t kill his brother to why he seems to be courting his sister-in-law, you try to make sense of his mother’s baffling sang froid towards two sons that aim to rip each other’s throat, you laugh at Lymond’s abduction of a certain lady and the way he outmanoeuvres his pursuers, you admire his pluck, his ruthlessness, his apparent flexible morality, his devil-may-care attitude in playing chess with humans that results in the death of an innocent woman . . . By the time of the duel, you think you know—as much as you can surmise from the obscure narrative—who and what he is and what he may be doing or may have done.<br /><br />But then the last pages come. The courtroom comes. And it all goes down in a crash.<br /><br />The author that hadn’t given a fig for whether her readers would or wouldn’t grasp what she was saying and what the storyline was about, resorts to a literary technique that smells suspiciously of Agatha Christie, in my opinion. We find out that, oh no, it wasn’t precious Lymond after all, it was that weakling Dandy. That’s so, folks, the assassin was the butler all along, and with a stroke of the plume everything that had added some layers of greyness, of human fallibility and base demeanour is swept away from Lymond’s sheet, which is left lily-white clean. And what’s worse, it’s not even Lymond who unveils it; it’s his mother. There’s a word for that trope: character idealisation, or in plain slang, Mary Sue-ness. <br /><br />The courtroom wasn’t an appropriate closure, it was anticlimactic. With it, the reader’s laborious mental work during the entirety of the book just doesn’t pay off. You were lost and buried under the avalanche of rhymes and preciousness, and didn’t understand what the thing was about? Don’t worry, it will be explained, no, spelt out in detail, to you at the end during Lymond’s trial. Without his distracting rhyming (for the most part) and obtuse referencing, so you won’t miss a thing. Isn’t it just wonderful; all that worry that you were missing something was for naught, all that theorising and guessing was for naught, the author is telling you what happened, so the job is done for you. <br /><br />This I can’t forgive Dame Dorothy for. One star is lost.<br /><br />THE CHARACTERISATION OF THE HERO: Although I tend to prefer deeply flawed men with scores of layers, men who aren’t redeemed with a stroke of a magical plume and that know what they are, unapologetically so, yet still are likable because one dozen or two of their layers are relatable, very human, I can also love the more conventionally perfect brand of literary heroes. With a caveat: that they must be believable. There is where the characterisation of Lymond fails. He isn’t believable; not only is he extremely capable at everything under the sun, which itself alone would be enough to cast a fake varnish over his character, but he’s also so young for all these achievements and besides he\\'s physically impressive. Sure, there were—and are—some extraordinary souls that can leave us mere mortals with our jaws hanging low in amazement. But they also have their darker sides. Which is Francis’? Hard to tell from the way Dunnett has described him. He feels more like an idealised Renaissance man raised exponentially to the Nth degree: a Leonardo da Vinci with the handsomeness of Leonardo DiCaprio and the luck of Lucifer and an early fame to match Alexander the Great. <br /><br />His idiosyncratic speech doesn’t help much either, but would’ve been better taken in if not for Dunnett’s decision to spread the same merry rhymin’ and recitin’ across several pages and characters, which brings me to the next point.<br /><br />THE LANGUAGE: For many readers, language is the sole reason they can’t persevere with this book, and a good reason this is. A very good one.<br /><br />As a polyglot myself, I didn’t have excessive trouble with the quotes in French and Spanish, and could comprehend the Latin quotations as well, and the German and Italian, without needing the Dunnett companion. I was able to recognise the source of many of them from earlier readings of Spanish writers from the period and some Roman classics; they aren’t that unknown to a well-read person as the Olde English ones. The Middle-English quotes gave me more headaches because they were just too obscure. I don’t know if, were they from more known period sources like, say, Shakespeare, a greater number of readers would’ve gotten them, because he’s more accessible. But that’s not the case, the quotes she includes, without name of the source, aren’t readily recognisable, which may be due to the fact that they’re chess quotes, though not all of them are. <br /><br />Because of that, and the fact that the quotes can be skipped with no loss, I said that my issue isn’t the language itself as much as what it does to the narrative. I’m not sure I can explain this in a way that conveys exactly what I mean, but I’ll try. <br /><br />First things first, let’s state the bare facts: the quotations aren’t restricted to chapter openings. They are all over the place, everywhere. Second: Lymond can’t speak without a quote thrown in to save his life. Third: And it’s not only Lymond, other characters are afflicted with the Quotation Fever as well. Now my point: it’s excessive. If the literary references were for chapter openings or for reinforcing the chess-imagery only, then very good. If not that, then if the quotations were made to be a speech quirk of Lymond’s only, it’d be counted as a character trait, irritating or endearing depending on the reader’s taste but no more than that. But he’s not the only one that speaks like that, others do too, and that gives the impression of being in the company of actors, not of real people that existed at the time. The little foreign-language lines are too distracting even if you don’t read them, because they interrupt the flow of the dialogue and force you to either stop to try to understand it, or to skip them, so you read dialogue hop-hopping from one English phrase to the next. And though likely the Guides that were written to clarify these will disagree with me on this, I can say that a good number of them are just too random and don’t really add to the narrative. At times, it even reads like Dunnett was just showing off; there are lines that could support my point. <br /><br />It’s that sense of unreality brought in by that narrative style what I liked the least. The period description and the historical accuracy may be splendid, though I disagree here (they aren\\'t), but the characterisation, the language and Dunnett’s storytelling left me with the sensation of watching a mummer’s show instead of real people in real events, which I appreciate in historical fiction. I felt like the characters were actors performing for an audience, they spoke like actors for an audience, and the events unfold just like in a scripted play in which the characters are the puppets moved by a master puppeteer, not events that unfold naturally and suffer the setbacks of chance and human nature. Mummery, in sum, it felt like mummery. Artificial, implausible, not believable. <br /><br />So, to conclude, the book loses two more stars on account of the last points, and is left with two only. Now, let\\'s move to the much-lauded accuracy and research by Dunnett.<br /><br />THE ACCURACY: Fans of this series like to slavishly praise it for its supposed impeccable historical research, and yet, in the very first opening scene there\\'s already a historical error. And there\\'s another in the first chapter, so you can imagine how many more there are if there\\'s this many so early in the book; those who know the history of the 16th century will be able to spot at least three early enough, and that\\'s not a good sign.<br /><br />Added to this accuracy point is the historicity/historical plausibility part. Dunnett falls in the same trap as many other writers: she has her fictional character meet and be close to all the important real characters. It\\'s not as heavy-handed in this first book, but throughout the series Lymond becomes a Forrest Gump of the 1500s, going from here to there to meet all the Big Names of the period like he has a bucket list, going as far as Russia. Do you find all this credible? His connections to the Scottish court and relationship with the child Queen already stretch credulity, but what happens in the next books break all sense of plausibility. Who in the historical record for the 16th century is there that\\'s remotely as well-connected and well-travelled and well-accepted everywhere regardless of religion and race as Lymond is? Nobody. Some might not mind it and love the grand adventure aspect, but I do demand plausibility in my Hist-Fic. Mindset wise, Lymond doesn\\'t belong in his period either. He\\'s very modern-minded, a product of the 1960s than of the 1560s, not a man of his times.<br /><br />THE TREATMENT OF FEMALE CHARACTERS: In AGOK, there\\'s one woman who is Lymond\\'s match in every sense: Christian Stewart, the blind lady of Boghall. She was well-educated, very smart, well-connected, independent and enterprising in spite of her blindness, and the only one who could talk with Lymond in his convoluted language. And she was sacrificed for male angst.<br /><br />Yes, Christian Stewart\\'s fate was merely for Lymond to angst over. It\\'s the equivalent of using female rape so the hero can angst and wangst over it for all eternity in the book, as it later happens in another book in the series. I have seen arguments that if she had lived she\\'d have been a \"burden\" for Lymond. Ableist hogwash! She was capable on her own, and her disability would\\'ve actually been a good way to realistically portray the challenges someone like her would have to face, which would\\'ve made for more challenging but interesting plots than grooming Pippa to be another sacrifice.<br /><br />All the women in this series are sacrifices on the altar of Lymond, misogynistically used to create, nurture, and grow his angst and suicidality. Even Kate, who supposedly escapes this fate, in reality doesn\\'t. She\\'s also sacrificed and given a consolation prize in the end in the form of a man that she didn\\'t really need. She could\\'ve kept her Gideon, but that would\\'ve meant less angst for Saint Francis the Perfect.<br /><br />And this is merely in the first book, because every single book in this series right until the epilogue of \"Checkmate\" has a woman sacrificed for Lymond. The first book has two, the second book has one, the third book has one, the fourth book has one, the fifth book has one, the last book has two. This is a very troubling pattern in Dunnett\\'s writing that few seem to be bothered by. I am bothered by this, and always have been. The sacrifice of Christian was the benchmark for me even before that awful plot point in \"Checkmate,\" and the more I\\'ve reread this, the more troubling I find it. How is it possible that a series where women live for the hero be praised for being so good with female characters? Don\\'t readers see the issue?<br /><br />THE LANGUAGE II: Another aspect Dunnett is undeservedly praised for is the use of foreign languages. For a character who supposedly speaks so many languages and is a linguistic wunderkind, Dunnett\\'s use of foreign language for Lymond isn\\'t that good. In fact, in this first book, it\\'s shitty.<br /><br />Take the Don Luis scene, which is offensively racist and relies entirely on stereotypes. I can tell Dunnett never met a Spaniard in her life if she thinks Will\\'s name would be pronounced \"Huile\" by a Spanish speaker. On top of that, she used Spanish incorrectly, there\\'s wrong words wrongly \"translated,\" and the articles are incorrect as well; even when a line is correct, that\\'s not the Spanish that would be spoken in the 1500s (see Don Quixote in the original for a quick check). Where\\'s the vaunted accuracy and linguistic gift? Nowhere.<br /><br />And that\\'s only one scene with one foreign ethnicity, don\\'t get me started on the depiction of the \"Gypsies\" in this book that is racist as well. And no, you can\\'t say it\\'s the characters that are, because the POV is universal narrator, ergo an authorial choice. In other books, there\\'s also racial stereotyping and exoticisation that is authorial choice and not characters\\' views.<br /><br />I could go on with examples, but I think the above suffice to make my point. I\\'ve reread this series enough times to know there\\'s no turning back for me. Some series survive several rereads, but <i>The Lymond Chronicles</i> was the opposite for me, and that is it. Am I sad? No, not really. I\\'m happy that I can say I\\'m done, leave my thoughts out in the open, and move on. Plenty of books in the world to love yet!<br /><br />________________________<br /><b>*</b> <i>Thank you, Ryan, Nastya, Nataliya, Clodia, Alexandra, Justin, Temperance.

       "   'text': '<b>$1.99 Kindle sale, June 23, 2019.</b> If you ever feel like you need a REALLY mentally challenging novel, I have the solution right here.<br><br><i>Game of Kings</i>, first published in 1961, is an intricate, well-plotted tale of the conflict between England and Scotland in 1547, when Mary Queen of Scots is a very young child, and the machinations of the various players in that conflict, especially Francis Crawford, called Lymond. Lymond is a young man, exiled from Scotland for treason, who has now snuck back into the country and is busy making waves and causing trouble, for reasons that gradually are revealed. <br><br>Dorothy Dunnett uses chess terms as chapter titles and Middle English quotes about chess at the start of most chapters, and really this book is very much like one massive chess game, played by a master player.<br><br>Parts of <i>Game of Kings</i> were completely fascinating: I always enjoy reading about a person who has their own mysterious agenda, which they follow to the end while everyone around them sees only their small piece of the puzzle. This book is very well-written, and a lot of the scenes really came to life for me. The last couple of hundred pages kept me up until past 1:30 am reading, since I couldn\\'t put the book down unfinished.<br><br>But (and this is a fairly large \"but\") any book that reminds me of reading <a href=\"https://goodreads.com/book/show/338798.Ulysses\" title=\"Ulysses by James Joyce\" rel=\"noopener\">Ulysses</a> in college, I\\'m going to have some issues with. Lymond is a brilliant scholar as well as an athlete ― and musician, and excellent swordsman and archer, and . . . well, I\\'m not sure there\\'s anything he doesn\\'t do well. Except not be an asshole. So aside from being a bit of a Gary Stu, which I have absolutely no issues with when the book is good enough, Lymond is given to dialogue that includes various quotes in French or Latin (which Dunnett <i>never</i> bothers translating for you) and obscure literary references that may have been familiar to well-read people back in the 16th century but certainly aren\\'t well-known now. I was an English major in college, and most of this stuff I did not get AT ALL. <br><img src=\"https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/hostedimages/1404402760i/10233747.gif\" width=\"250\" height=\"280\" alt=\"description\" class=\"gr-hostedUserImg\" loading=\"lazy\"> <br>Here\\'s a sample Lymond quote (and no, this is <u>not</u> atypical):<blockquote>\"Don\\'t you think it\\'s time my family shared in my misfortunes, as Christians should? Then, vice is so costly: May dew or none, my brown and tender diamonds don\\'t engender, they dissolve. Immoderation, Mariotta, is a thief of money and intestinal joy, but who\\'d check it? Here I am, weeping soft tears of myrrh, to prove it.\"</blockquote>I rest my case. I also had a challenge following the political maneuvering and battles, although that may not be a problem for more historically savvy readers.<br><br>Several people told me that you just need to let the parts that you don\\'t understand roll over you. Ignore them and just go on, was their advice. And yes, that worked pretty well, but still, any book written as late as 1961 that needs to (and does!) have several guidebooks written about it to help readers get all the in-jokes and obscure quotes and references, maybe has a bit too much going on for its own good.<br><br>I should be fair and add that most people in the book talk like normal people. Even Lymond, when he\\'s not trying to be mysterious or evasive, can use plain speech. And if you\\'re willing to take on (or overlook) the difficult parts, there is <u>so much</u> in this book to love. Lymond\\'s adventures, as well as his problematic relationships with his brother; his second-in-command, Will Scott; a blind woman, Christian Stewart; and others make for incredible, sometimes humorous and often very exciting reading. <br><br>So, marvelous book, but minus a star for being a little too obscure and difficult and making me all irritated and surly for the first 100 pages, until I just got over it. :) One of these times I\\'m going to reread it, and maybe my rating will go up then.<br><br>Thanks so much to Marquise for the buddy read! <br><br>ETA: <a href=\"https://goodreads.com/book/show/112080.Queens__Play__The_Lymond_Chronicles___2_\" title=\"Queens\\' Play (The Lymond Chronicles, #2) by Dorothy Dunnett\" rel=\"noopener\">Queens\\' Play</a>, the second book in this series, is much easier to read--though still challenging--and incredibly gripping and rewarding. So if you gave up on Dunnett after Game of Kings, I encourage you to give the second one a shot.',\n",

       "   'text': \"This book, and how I feeeeeel about this book. They demand flights of eloquence and rhetorical brilliance that I just don’t have right now. Or probably ever, if I’m honest, not for this.<br /><br />It’s only the second time I’ve read this cover-to-cover. But pieces of this book are graven into me. Particular turns of phrase from scenes I’ve read over again – “I despised men who accepted their fate. I shaped mine twenty times and had it broken twenty times in my hands.” And more fundamental things. I remembered the fact of Lymond’s speech about patriotism, but not it’s chilling, blazing content. Yet when I got to it again, it rang my whole brain like a bell because it turns out I <i>did</i> remember, I just remembered so far down it felt like it came from me.<br /><br />It’s a book with speeches, let me just repeat that.<br /><br />Okay, some actual content. This is Scotland, 1547, conflict sparking with England, France circling. It’s a story of nations, but mostly it’s about the lost son coming home, about his brother’s marriage bending and bending until the cracks show, it’s about his extraordinary mother, and their friends, and a long, awful, painful coming in from the cold. I love them all <i>so much</i> I am helpless about it. This is a ridiculous, absurd book where the main character is incomprehensible 75% of the time if you don’t have a Ph.D. in sixteenth-century literature, and you don’t have the faintest idea what anything means for about 500 pages, and I love it as passionately and unreservedly as all its excesses demand. It's about the flaw, the break, the shattering, and building strength from personal anialation. And in the last, a humanitarianism so strong, it feels brutal.<br /><br />...Nope, definitely don't have it in me.\",\n",

He can be anything, and do everything. Musician, swordsman, master strategist, man of breeding and education, accomplished linguist, actor, lover, patriot. Man of mystery, gifted with intelligence and good looks. And with the most amazing head for recalling obscure text and poems (in any number of languages) at just the right moment.<br><br>On the plus side, <b>\\n  <i>The Game of Kings</i>\\n</b> is complex, layered and brilliantly researched. However, it is so often mired in French, Latin, Spanish and archaic English poems and texts <b>\\n  <i>with no translations,</i>\\n</b> that it becomes a chore. Lymond, our hero, is the worst offender:<br><br><i>\"I am a narwhal looking for my virgin. I have sucked up the sea like Charybdis and failing other entertainment will spew it three times daily, for a fee. Tell me again, precisely, what you have just said about Mungo Tennant.\"</i><br><br>Forget about Mungo, tell me precisely, what <b>you</b> have just said, Lymond.<br><br>Though sometimes categorised as historical romance, it isn\\'t. This first book is not even romantic historical fiction. The first third to half of this book is like wading through molasses in winter. It does pick up after that. There’s a method to Lymond’s madness. If you can stick with it, it does finally pay off. But the road to get there is often bumpy, difficult to traverse, with <i>occasional</i> glimmers of brilliance that help propel the reader forward. Mired in minutiae, it’s hard to see the big picture here.<br><br>Dorothy Dunnett is a master storyteller, and an exquisite wordsmith. A classical education, (perhaps even a master\\'s degree in English Literature and a facility with a number of languages) notwithstanding, a reader is not going to <i>fully</i> understand or appreciate this. Let’s be honest here, you’re not <i>really</i> going to enjoy it completely either, if you can only understand a half or two-thirds of it.<br><br><i> “I wish to God,” said Gideon, with mild exasperation, “that you’d talk – just once – in prose like other people.”</i><br><br>So say we all!<br><br>This is not an easy, accessible read by any means. However, there are scenes and lines that are bursts of brilliance:<br><br>Here, Lymond is laying down the law to his band of outlaws:<br><i>Disobey me in action or in spirit, gentleman, and you’ll stay alive much longer than you want to…” Absolute silence.</i><br><br>And this, when Lymond is posing as a palm reader (although the lady knows who he is):<br><i>Firmly, her wrist was taken, and the fingers spread out. “A fine, capable hand. Line of life – hullo! You appear to have died at the age of seven.”<br><br>“The embalmers are exceedingly skilful nowadays,” she said gravely.</i><br><br>While it’s safe to say Ms Dunnett was a literary genius, I also think it’s safe to say that only a handful of readers might be able to fully appreciate <b>\\n  <i>The Game of Kings.</i>\\n</b> For first-time readers, here’s a hint: just read it avoiding the untranslated texts, gloss over the rhymes and riddles of Lymond, and you <i>might</i> end up enjoying it. However, to fully appreciate this novel (and series) it needs to be <b>\\n  <i>studied.</i>\\n</b> On a second or third read, buy the guide and companions, join discussion forums, and peel back the layers of Lymond.<br><br>There <b>\\n  <i>is</i>\\n</b> a lot to enjoy but quite frankly teasing out these pockets of bliss from amongst the other stuff is work. For some readers, it’s not going to be worth it. All in all, <b>\\n  <i>The Game of Kings</i>\\n</b> is a very uneven read for me. When a good quarter or a third, is totally unintelligible and seems to be there purely as a gilt-edged frame to highlight the author\\'s masterpiece (which it is...in places), I can\\'t give a novel 5, or even 4 stars.<br><br>However, I enjoyed <b>\\n  <i>The Game of Kings</i>\\n</b> enough to continue the series. <br><br><i>* Thanks, Searock for the buddy-read and suggesting another read of this classic</i><br><br>',\n",

       "   'text': 'Being a fan of Game of Kings—of any Dunnett novel—is a strange experience. The fandom is passionate, but of plenty of folks, understandably, don’t get what the fuss is about. Dunnett makes no concessions to readers. You have to think about what you are reading. With Dunnett, it’s important to consider the possibilities and implications of each interaction—which can take you out of the story.<br /><br />Plus, Dunnett is given to quotations in Renaissance French, Spanish, and Latin without the benefit of translation (which can also take you out of the flow) And her hero frequently comes off as a terrible person, although he invariably has his reasons. <br /><br />But if you are willing to do what the author demands, (the thinking and the Latin Googling, and the adapting yourself to her style), what you get is a dazzling portrait of the High Renaissance, with an equally dazzling cast of characters at its heart. <br /><br />In Game of Kings, the first book of the Lymond Chronicles, Francis Crawford of Lymond, disgraced younger son of a noble Scottish family, returns to Scotland, an outlaw, after a long absence. The year is 1547, Henry VIII’s young son Edward is on the throne of England, and skirmishing between England and Scotland is happening all along the borders. <br /><br />With this background of turmoil, and at the head of a band of fellow outlaws, Francis will reunite with his estranged family, strike up a complex friendship with the heir to a great estate, and with his outlaws, interfere in the political workings of England and Scotland—but is he betraying his country or saving it, trying to clear his name, or just cause trouble? <br /><br />The thing that strikes you first is Dunnett’s prose. It is dense, rich, distinctive, full of allusion, implication, and subtlety. Often she will imply something rather than tell the reader outright. Her descriptions—of clothing, food, weather, are incredibly evocative.<br /><br />The second thing that strikes you is her hero, Francis. He starts off insufferable: a prosy, high-handed know-it-all, too clever and pretty for his own good, and in his second on-page appearance he breaks into his own mother’s castle, robs it, and sets it on fire. It’s hard to muster sympathy for him for the vast majority of the book. But nothing is as it appears, and if you are willing to put up with Francis, the unfolding of his story—including the purpose behind his actions—will hit you like a rock to the forehead late in the game, one of those fantastic ah-ha moments that every writer hopes to give their readers. <br /><br />And fortunately Francis is surrounded by a vivid and appealing supporting cast, in which one is happy to find a lot of amazing women. Francis’ indomitable mother, his friend the blind but dauntless Christian Stewart, the romantic Agnes Herries, and the severely practical Kate Somerville are standouts. <br /><br />Add to that a plot that ticks along like a good stopwatch, a dry, subtle sense of humor, and just a wonderfully romantic sensibility, without stooping to cliché, and you have a winning combination. Not romance in the sense of love or sex, although that plays a part. But romance in the sense of swordfights, last stands, desperate escapes, grand sacrifices, a larger-than-life hero. All those things can be found in Dunnett’s work, and she can and will dazzle you, like her hero, if you just give her time to do so.<br /><br />To conclude, I have two pieces of advice for readers just embarking on their first read of Game of Kings:<br /><br />1)\\tIf, after the first chapter, you find yourself asking, “Buy why was the pig drunk?” you aren’t reading closely enough. <br /><br />2)\\tBefore passing judgment on Francis, wait until you find out who the Spanish nobleman is. <br />',\n",

       "   'text': \"Six stars out of five for Dorothy Dunnett. She's in class of her own when it comes to historical fiction and, while I continue to enjoy the epics told by Bernard Cornwell or Patrick O'Brian (the ones I'm currently in the middle of), I have to admit that in a celebrity deathmatch they would come second place to the Lymond / Niccolo series. Fans of the author tend towards unbridled enthusiasm (witness the 4,42 median rating here on Goodreads - the highest I've come across so far, and the international conventions meeting in places of import from the books). So what is the secret of this amazing popularity, seeing as the number of votes is relatively low? I could point out to the erudition and the word plays that rival Umberto Eco, to the wild swashbuckling adventures that surpass even Alexandre Dumas, to the intricate puzzles and whodunnit investigations that pay tribute to Arthur Conan Doyle or Agatha Christie, the grand vision, panoramic scope that challenge Gone with the Wind and War and Peace, and last but not least the wild, absurd, disruptive sense of humour that reminds me of the best of Blackadder or Monty Python (<i> 'We need to uthe thronger perthuathion. The men below are obviouthly in colluthion too.' </i> - Lord Grey channelling Michael Palin as Pontius Pilates). <br /><br />All these aspects are part of the attraction, but I believe above and beyond the technical skills and the richness of the setting, the books of Dorothy Dunnet are about passion : for history, for the people that made history and for living life to the full. Wikipedia mentions that the inception of the Lymond Chronicles came when Dunnett complained to her husband that she has run out of things to read, and he suggested she should write her own. Thus we are reading the kind of tale a voracious reader wrote for her own enjoyment, and we tag along with googly eyes and mouths open in wonder. As for the low number of votes : the books were written five decades ago, so they lack the exposure of newcomers on the scene. They are also too big for impulse buyers and too complex to be included in a school curriculum (maybe at university level). These factors combine to keep away the casual browser of library shelves, but attract the more dedicated readers of history and the ones who prefer sprawling, immersive adventures. And once you pass the initial reluctance to invest time and effort in 13 books you end up under Dunnett spell.<br /><br /><i> I wished to explore, within several books, the nature and experiences of a classical hero: a gifted leader whose star-crossed career, disturbing, hilarious, dangerous, I could follow in finest detail for ten years. And I wished to set him in the age of the Renaissance. </i><br /><br />Enters Francis Crawford of Lymond, younger son of the Coulter family. The year is 1547 and Scotland is like 'a lark surrounded by crocodiles'. After a series of disastrous military campaigns, most of the nobles are either dead, prisoners across the Border or secretly in the pay of the English who claim the hand of the six year old Queen Mary in marriage to their own infant heir to the throne. At the start of the novel Francis is an outlaw, hunted across the realm for betraying his side to the English, and at the most basic level the plot can be resumed as the struggle of Francis to clear his name and discover who and how he was framed. Complicating the issue is the deadly rivalry between Francis and his older brother, the heir to the Coulter castle and lands, his responsibility in the death of their beloved sister, a budding romance with a blind heiress and a dysfunctional relationship with young and idealistic Will Scott, who wants to become an apprentice to the charysmatic outlaw leader.<br /><br /><b> The Game of Kings </b> reflects the battle for Scottish sovereignty through the language and tactics of chess. The analogy is deeply embedded at all the levels of the story - from the opening moves of Lymond stealing his mother's jewels, burning the family castle and flirting with his brother's wife, to his game of cat and mouse playing both sides against each other and stealing equally from the British and from the Scots, to the relative role of each piece on the board - passive kings and queens, fiery knights, besieged towers, wild horse runs or bishops betrayals.<br /><br /><i> The rybauldes, players of dyce And the messangers and corrours ought to be sette tofore the rook. For hit apperteyneth to the rook ... to have men convenable for to renne here and there for tenquire and espie the place and cyties that myght be contrarye to the kynge. </i><br /><br />Each chapter is prefaced by a reference to the game, written in old English and usually related to the current developments in the plot. As a side note, don't get unnerved by the apparent obscurity of these introductions: the rest of the novel is written in plain English, or what Dunnett considers plain English in the context of the Renaissance: authentic Scots idiom seasoned with Latin, French, Italian, occasional German, Dutch and Spanish, verses from popular ballads and court poets, references to mythology and the equivalent of XVI century pop culture. It comes as no surprise that the Lymond / Nicollo Chronicles have spawned a two volume hefty companion book that references and translates and comments on all the trivia and all the research included in the original books. I am lucky to be familiar with the major European languages and with several modern Scottish authors, and to have the patience and the drive to solve / compose crossword puzzles, but even so I could not claim to have caught every nuance and every reference here. There's just too damn many of them, every time a character opens his / her mouth, especially Lymond. But I had no problem following the gist of the conversations and the more subtle put-downs or barbed arrows of irony. The book practically begs for a re-read, both for spotting the later developments as they are first introduced (Lymond is always thinking and responding to his adversaries with several moves ahead of the game, like a true chess grandmaster) and for taking a breather from the frantic pacing and spend some leisure time with Wikipedia and with the reference books, savouring the more obscure points of the text.<br /><br />Coming back to Francis Lymond, the hero of the epic, I can understand but I cannot subscribe to the theory that he is a Gary Stu, unrealistic, uberpowerful and infallible. Yes, he is super smart, good looking, proficient with bow and sword, well read and a musical prodigy, but he is not supposed to be an ordinary Joe or a farmboy with a secret identity and a prophecy to fulfil, he is a Renaissance man, a natural born leader, a hero of his time period. Most of his talents can be explained by the fact that he is a second son, who inherits nothing and who has the pressing incentive to make his own place in the world, and by the circumstances forced on him: warrior, prisoner, galley slave, outlaw leader, spy, etc. In addition to his talents, there is the way Dunnett is treating him, like a bar of iron that is heated and re-heated in the fire of adversity and then moulded into shape with sledgehammers until the sword is sharp and deadly. (<i> This peculiar mental agility of yours has been no friend to you, has it? Without it, you might have survived, harmless, in a lukewarm limbo of drink and drugs and insipid women! </i>)<br /><br />He is an actor who struggles to give up his mask and change the role Fate and the lords of the land have written for him, he tries to do right by his followers and by his friends, but more often than not the results are hurtful to guilty and innocents alike. He makes mistakes, big ones, in keeping with his big struggles. He learns painfully that a leader is responsible for the lives of the people he involves in his plans and for the unforeseen consequences of his actions.<br /><br /><i> And now where are we? It's difficult, isn't it, to know whom to trust? Fide et diffide, in fact: and that is the moral of this little story. Be mistrustful, and you will live happy and die hated and be much more useful to me in between. </i><br /><br />In a great supporting role is Will Scott, who wants to learn from Lymond how to lead, how to be free of family and patriotic obligations, how to control his own life. Where Francis is practical and cynical, Will is idealistic and impulse driven. He is easily manipulated because he doesn't follow through the moves of the chess game far enough into the future. Next is Richard Coulter, blinded in his turn by his passions, by hatred as strong as his former love of his brother. Insufficient or false knowledge drive both Will and Richard to pit themselves against Francis and his plans in a struggle that sees a new twist and reversal of fortunes every other page. Appearances are misleading and more than one killer may be interested in putting Francis Lymond out of the game. <br /><br />I could pick any of the major themes of the novel (<i> Patriotism is a fine hothouse for maggots. It breeds intolerance </i>, family relations, youth versus experience, law versus freedom) for a more indepth analysis, but I would like to pause for a moment on the way Dunnett treated gender roles in the novel. While men have the lion's share of the action and women are generally relegated to passive roles as childbearers and household managers, the end result is refreshingly well balanced with the ladies more than holding their own in the unravelling of the mysteries and as adept in working from the shadows as the men are at swinging their axes and swords. Stately clan matron Sybilla Coulter, fiery Irish wife Mariotta Coulter, no-nonsense Lady Buccleuth, romantically challenged thirteen year old heiress Agnes Herries, malefic Margaret Douglas countess of Lennox, reliable and sensible Christian Stewart - they usually surpass their men in wit and fortitude. I particularly like the way Dunnett moulded her militant feminism to the social strictures of the period and didn't try to endow her heroines with modern sensibilities. There is friction and misunderstanding between the genders, but there are also open channels of communication and the promise of a path together, side by side into the future. As George Douglas responds to Agnes Herries on the lack of romance in arranged marriages:<br /><br /><i> It's pretty well a full-time job, these days, keeping a family housed and clothed and warm and protected. Doesn't leave much time for poetry under the apple trees. But chivalry hasn't gone: don't think it. You'll even find it paramount still with some people, but a trifle the worse for wear, because it's not the best protection against an aggressive and materialistic world ... </i><br /><br />I've run out of bookmarks, and I still feel that I only touched on the surface of the story, that I didn't stress enough how wildly entertaining and how intellectually stimulating the journey was. I've actually put off writing the review for a couple of months, hoping for inspiration to match the enthusiasm I felt reading it, but as I'm already halfway through book three of Lymond I was in danger of falling too far behind to ever reach closure. Maybe I'll rewrite when I get around to reading the books again, this time back to back with the house of Niccolo, to see how they are related. Until then, I'll leave you with these rambling notes.\",\n",

       "   'text': \"<b>First reread 3 months later (I know, I know...)</b><br />So ok, it's obviously 5 stars, duh. This time I enjoyed it even more, knowing all the characters and noticing Dunnett's carefully planted clues. And every emotional scene hit me like a ton of bricks. <br />Just absolutely incredible!<br />(I promised myself I would read very slowly this time, failed and read the last 200 pages in one day. Argh!)<br /><br />-------------------------<br />Mary Queen of Scots is just a young child, the coveted prize-bride for young king Edward of England with Scotland as dowry. France wants the same and also put some pressure on England. <br />Mysterious Lymond returns to Scotland after the 5 year absence with a tarnished reputation. A grand political chess game begins. <br /><br />Lymond is an incredible protagonist. He is the most accomlished young man on the planet and always 5 steps ahead of every other character. And it would have been so frustrating if we had a first-person or third-person limited narration, but thankfully we don't. We never see his POV, we only get glimpses of him through other characters’ eyes most of the tine. You never know what’s his plan and end game. Imagine Jack Sparrow if he was Scottish, overeducated and blond; but as drunk and scheming.<br /><br />What ensues next is a great adventure story of double crosses, triple crosses, politics, betrayals, swashbuckling and <s>melo</s>drama.<br />I've seen some reviewers calling this book pretentious and calling Dunnett a show-off but nothing could be further from the truth. But it is smart, subtle and requires attention from the reader. <br /><blockquote>“The Scot, the Frencheman, the Pope and heresie, overcommed by Trothe have had a fall. Again yes.”<br />“I wish to God,” said Gideon with mild exasperation, “that you’d talk—just once—in prose like other people.” </blockquote><br /><br />And the writing is so smart and gorgeous, sometimes very cheeky, the book is intricately plotted and the author respects her readers. It can be confusing at first, you are dropped into the middle of the war with a lot of actors. But it didn’t last long.<br />And I loved so many characters - papa Buccleuch, Christian Stewart, Somervilles, Agnes, mama bear, even grumpy Richard to name a few.<br />If you’re a fan of historical fiction with fun adventures, you need to give this a try! I gobbled it up in 2 days.<br />Now please excuse me, I'm going back to the 16th century.\",\n",

       "   'text': 'On re-reading this (listening to the audio-book) I had a far less gushy response (see below!) and also noticed how Dunnett upends what we expect from historical fiction. For there is no \\'love story\\' for Lymond - or, at least, not in a romantic sense. Instead, we see a reconciliation with love of family, love of country (and that big court speech on the dangers of patriotism and its ability to make enemies of fellow humans is tremendous) and the love of friendship. <br /><br />It\\'s other characters who go on a journey towards maturation: Richard and Mariotta, Will Scott. And, at the end, Lymond finds sanctuary and relief <input type=\"checkbox\" class=\"spoiler__control\" aria-label=\"The following text has been marked spoiler.

Dunnett never writes down to her readers, and if that means quoting lightly in Latin, medieval French or Arabic, then she goes right on ahead to do it, because that\\'s the way the character would speak.<br /><br />Not that these are over-intellectualised, \\'novels of ideas\\' either - they are simply the most stunning evocation of 16th century Europe, brought to us with true characters who walk off the pages and live their lives as they choose.<br /><br />In \\'Kings\\', Lymond returns to his home in Scotland, pursued by his bad reputation and an aura of evil. Called traitor, murderer and, potentially, fratricide, he plays out the game amongst the Scottish families closest to the throne of Mary of Guise and her young child, Mary Queen of Scots.<br /><br />I don\\'t want to give anything about the plot, because it is so intricate and every small comment fits in later, but this remains one of my top series of books ever.',\n",

       "   'text': '<b>Doubleday/Vintage Anchor has reprinted the Lymond Chronicles series. with gorgeous new covers in paperback form. I loved my first adventures with Lymond! </b> ⭐️ ⭐️ ⭐️ ⭐️ <br /><br />Francis Crawford of Lymond stands accused of many crimes, including deceit, drunkenness, murder, and treason. It’s 1547 when he returns to his native Scotland, just as it is threatened by an English invasion. <br /><br />Lymond leads a group of outlaws and dissidents to defend his land, as well as his name. Lymond is the second son, and second in line for any inheritance. <br /><br />Classical literature references abound, always testing me and adding fun when I actually knew one. Characters also abound, and we are on pins and needles as we wait to find out if Lymond is guilty or innocent. <br /><br />Lymond is in a fight to end all fights with his brother, and the outcome will determine if Lymond dies or is welcomed back into the fold of his family. <br /><br />Mary Queen of Scots is here, too, but too young to truly lead, which is why Lymond and men like him have to join up and join in to make sure Scotland remains a kingdom. <br /><br />There are true-to-history characters mixed in with fictional ones. Lymond is a main character to champion: complex, foolhardy, passionate, clever, impressive. <br /><br />The writing is rich and intricately detailed and is rather sumptuous overall. I’m so grateful there is a series to continue on with because I can’t wait to read Lymond’s next adventure, where he escorts Mary Queen of Scots to France. I’m so grateful this book and series was put on my radar because I have lots of adventure ahead of me! <br /><br />I received a complimentary copy.

       "   'text': 'Ever love a series of books so much that it is hard to describe just why you love them?<br /><br />I love Lymond. He is my all-time favorite hero. He’s a 16th century polyglot scholar, soldier-for-hire, poet, musician, nobleman, and treasonous outlaw. He’s trying to clear his name (as a traitor to Scotland – his homeland), and yet his methods are so convoluted and often counter-productive that everything he does is a muddle. He is fascinating.<br /><br />I love the language that Dunnett uses to make Lymond and the rest of the characters come alive. Even their names have a ring to them. (\"Turkey Mat,\" \"the Lang Cleg,\" \"Johnnie Bullo,\" even “Sybilla”) At times the language can be too much. When characters speak in foreign tongues (or quote them), there is no translation. Most of it I can puzzle out, but it’s not easy. Plus there are constant references to things that I knew nothing about. Lymond’s opening line is: “I am a narwal looking for my virgin. I have sucked up the sea like Charybdis and failing other entertainment will spew it three times daily, for a few.” Believe it or not, there is actually a strong, coherent statement in that. But you need Wikipedia to puzzle it out.<br /><br />I love the drama of Lymond’s story. In particular I love his relationship with his brother, his mother, Will Scott, and the blind Christian Stewart. I love that they each both love him and despise him.<br /><br />I love the accurate historical details. I love the ‘feeling’ of the story. This is not a costume party book.<br /><br />I love everything about The Lymond Chronicles. The series are by far, my most cherished books.<br />',\n",

       "   'text': 'My best effort at a response to this great read is to cheat and direct you to the fine reviews of <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/153390106\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Algernon</a> and <br /><a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/580797317\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Jeffry Keeten</a>. They covers so well its themes of betrayal and loss, love and loyalty, its stimulating mix of humor and adventure, and richness in characters and language.<br /><br />As a brief orientation, we are treated to the capers, conflicts, and liaisons of a mysterious outlaw in Scotland in the 1540’s, a time when the British and French are competing to eventually take over Scotland by setting up the marriage of their princes to the four-year old Queen Mary. Lymond is the second son of an aristocratic family but now reviled by his fellow Scots for betraying their forces to the invading British army five years earlier, resulting in tragic losses, including a sister. Even his own brother is after his hide. At the same time, he is an enemy to the Brits for signs of double-crossing them too. He takes up life on the run and living off banditry with a colorful cast of followers. His network of schemes and interventions is a confusing web which is subsumed under the metaphors of chess in the chapter structure. Whether Lymond is just a justifiable scoundrel in the face of all the brutal politics and personal guilt or has a secret noble cause is unclear for much of the book. <br /><br />I could tolerate such painful uncertainty because of the lively plot elements and plenty of lingering in the dialog and characters that make this such a rich and rewarding read. The arcane lingo took some getting used to render fluid comprehension, but as with reading Shakespeare a bit of looseness of the mind helps let the meaning flow. Unusual words and snatches of Latin and French can send you looking things up or lead you to my lazy shortcut of driving on with the context to carry the content. For example, you can just grok that “whaup and peewit” are birds and let that stand, and make your own meaning for “cheeks plimmed” and “fustian coat” But sometimes it was worth the effort of looking up some wonders, such as digging to find that “dance a vuelta on the widdy” is to dance a tango on the end of a noose.<br /><br />Ultimately, the tale had the feel of classic adventure tales like Zorro, Three Musketeers, and The Prisoner of Zenda and the charm of characterization reaching toward that of Patrick O’Brian. Some characters show their true selves or meet their just fate, and in that way the book is a romance. Those who meet ironic fates or stumble and bumble are part of the comedy. Underlying all is the tragedy of all the “collateral damage” and treachery among family and friends arising from Scotland’s unstable state among the wolves. I liked the capsule <a href=\"http://www.heroesandheartbreakers.com/blogs/2014/01/loving-lymond-dorothy-dunnett-lymond-chronicles\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">summary</a> of blogger Regina Thorne that the book is “the Scottish love-child of Alexandre Dumas and Dorothy L. Sayers, with an added layer of psychological complexity and political maneuvering that is reminiscent of Game of Thrones”.<br /><br /><br />',\n",

       "   'text': \"Listen. I'm not going to say much here and I'm going to refer the other books in the series to this review. This is my all time favorite series of books (it goes with the Niccolo series) and I don't think anything will ever even come close to topping it. It's historical fiction at its best--accurate, well drawn, witty, intelligent, perfectly researched, and intricately designed. If you have ever wanted to live in a different time period, this is as close as you're going to get. These are not beach books. They are so deeply enmeshed with each other and so perfectly written that someone wrote a guide to go with them. However, they are so worth it. If your brain and your imagination love to play, these will not disappoint. Finally, I dare you not to fall in love with the protagonist. Sigh. \",\n",

       "   'text': \"<b>Why fans of the Captive Prince should read <i>Game of Kings</i>.</b><br /><br />On numerous occasions, the author of the Captive Prince has cited Dorothy Dunnett as a major influence on her work. In particular, Pacat has modeled her character Laurent on the hero of this book, Francis Crawford of Lymond. <br /><br />For me, (for Damen), and I think for many fans, Laurent is the center of our attention. He captivates us, and though told through Damen’s perspective, the story truly revolves around him. <br /><br />The similarities between Lymond and Laurent are apparent. Both are fair-haired, blue-eyed second sons; both are master swordsmen, intensely loyal, and sharp-tongued leaders; both have wretched reputations which their enemies abuse in heartbreaking fashion. <br /><br />Laurent has an unwavering sense honor to match Damen’s, though he goes about it in backwards, sometimes counter-intuitive ways. He’s mysterious, hard to unravel, and impossible to predict. That’s what makes him so irresistible. And that’s what Lymond embodies. <br /> <br />The first time we meet him, we're greeted lines like: <blockquote>\\n  <i>“Lymond, a man of wit and crooked felicities, bred to luxury and heir to a fortune, rode off serenely to Midcutler to break into his new sister-in-law’s castle.”</i>\\n</blockquote><i>Game of Kings</i> follows Lymond on a quest to restore his name to his fellow Scots, his story set against the English border disputes that plagued much of 16th century British history. <br /><br />If you liked watching Laurent go undercover at the inn to deliver a coded message and then make a daring escape over the rooftops, just wait until you see Lymond adopt a ridiculous alter ego and sack a castle with its own defenses. <br />If you got chills hearing Laurent chastise Aimeric, wait until you hear Lymond rip apart his foes with the glorious fury of his words. <br />If you cheered when the army marches in at the end of Vol. 2, wait until Lymond orchestrates victories, turning battlefields into chess games where only he controls the board. <br /><br />Here’s you’ll find life-or-death battles of wit, epic sword fights, and sweeping adventure. You’ll find bravery pitted against honor, and love against power. There’s tension, and beauty, and some of the most gorgeous writing ever written. <br /><br />The style is sparse, yet jam packed with information, making this a long, involved read. The references to literature, poetry and myths make understanding Lymond’s speech a slow, sometimes frustrating process, so much so that one character burst out, <i>“I wish to God that you’d talk – just once – in prose like other people!”</i> But don’t let that stop you. I read this book with a pen in hand, taking notes and folding pages, which I think helped. I also learned some cool new words like “sartorial,” “erumpent” and “susurrus.”<br /><br />From a gender perspective, it’s fantastic to read historical fiction where the women in the story are intelligent, vital characters. And icing on the cake, Dunnett codes Lymond as feminine while he’s clearly dominating everyone in the room. It’s amazing.<br /><br />Keep in mind – this is not a romance, it’s not dripping in homoeroticism and there’s very little sex. But for all the other wonderful reasons <i>Captive Prince</i> stands out above the rest, you’ll find here in Dororthy Dunnett’s series. <br /><br />During the wait for Kings Rising – and let’s be honest, when we all finish it the next day – Lymond and all his mysteries will be there, just waiting to be discovered. <br /><br />\",\n",

       "   'text': 'Francis Crawford of Lymond, 16C\\'s James Bond? What fun! Its 1547, Henry VIII is dead and his young son Edward VII sits on the throne, as does a very young Mary sit on the throne of Scotland. Negotiations were made and broken to betroth young Mary to Edward and cement the two countries - or will the Scots marry her off to the dauphin of France instead? Francis Crawford of Lymond, a disgraced nobleman accused of treason sneaks back into Scotland and thus the game begins (to clear his name? is he working for the English as a spy? to murder his brother so that Lymond can inherit the Culter estates?). <br /><br />Francis and his band of \"merry men\" immediately begin to wreak havoc, including setting fire to his brother\\'s estate after stealing the silver and holding the ladies (including his mother) at knife point for their jewelry. Throughout, Francis\\' brilliant wit, sarcasm and heroism keep the reader enthralled and at times laughing out loud. Lymond\\'s escapades take him up and down the breadth of Scotland as Dunnett slowly peels back the layers of her story and keeps the reader guessing until the very end, finishing in a trial of ups and downs, twists and turns ala Perry Mason. <br /><br />This is not an easy tale to get into, especially if you have no passing knowledge of the Tudor/Stuart courts and noblemen during the 16C. Dunnett also liberally sprinkles her text with quotes from Latin, French and Olde English, you can purchase her companion book if you must know every word and nuance but I did just fine without it -- just skip the Latin you won\\'t miss it. However, it\\'s well worth the effort to stick with it until you \"get it\" as you will be well rewarded with a jolly good yarn, with as much action, excitement and swashbuckling good sword play as you would find in any Dumas novel -- for me that is the highest compliment I can give any author. A solid five stars, and I am now starting book two in the series, Queens\\' Play (Lymond Chronicles, 2). ',\n",

       "   'text': '<b>*** 4.65 ***<br /><br /><i>“I wish to God,” said Gideon with mild exasperation, “that you’d talk—just once—in prose like other people.” </i></b><br /><br />What a storyteller! In my eyes, Dorothy Dunnett can do no wrong, but I am not blind to certain elements of her story construction which are not very desirable. She is a wordsmith, a great historical researcher, a creator of characters who are larger than life and walk the gray area between good and evil to a degree you are never sure where they stand, are smart, devious, and perfectly fit their time period. I have rarely read authors who manage to weave historical facts with fictional characters in such a seamless manner. Her immense knowledge of language and literature through the ages is breathtaking, and I for one truly appreciate it. However, most of those qualities are the same ones which seem to repel many a reader, and I understand that too. I am a firm believer that you should read whatever makes you happy and speaks to you. It just so happens that what some may perceive as cumbersome or bloated, I find beautiful and a gymnastics for the brain. I love the manner in which she creates her dialogue, despite not loving very much how she complicates the plot by linguistic misunderstandings and characters, whom I would like to shake and say \"just say what you mean, not just what is true, but misleading when taken out of context!!!\". That is actually my biggest pet peeve with all of her work. To me that leads to unnecessary manufactured drama, when there is enough drama in the story to begin with. But I know many of my favorite authors use this method, so I have learned to live with it.<br /><br />Otherwise the story, about Francis Crawford of Lymond of Scotland, second son of a noble family, during the Rough Wooing period between England and Scotland after the death of Henry the Viii, is brilliant and informative, but also managed to make me care deeply about some of the characters, to a degree I actually cried like a baby when one of them met her demise under very cruel circumstances. If I could have, I would have strangled her assailant with my own hands! Had bad dreams all night.... <br /><br />The final chapters include a trial, where the author brings one of the best arguments about the meaningless of the concept of Patriotism I have ever come across! Despite our best desires to accept that as many cultural differences as there are, we as people, as human beings are the same, when you bring the fervency of Patriotism in the mix, all best intentions of harmony between different peoples goes out of the window... I am not saying it is a bad thing, I am just saying it is a bit absurd when you look at the big picture... <br /><br />I will recommend this book to anyone who enjoys historical fiction which stays true to the period and tends to get a bit verbose, but in a good way, in my opinion. Of course, I accept that many would probably not enjoy it, so make sure you get an excerpt before you commit to buying it. <br /><br />❤️😃👍',\n",

       "   'text': 'Do you have a book – or a series of books – that you keep in a box marked ‘ I want to read, it, I know I’ll love it, but I have to wait for the perfect moment’ ?<br /><br />I did – I still do.<br /><br />And I say that because Dorothy Dunnett’s books used to live in that box, but they don’t live there any more.<br /><br />I began to collect those books when they were out of print in this country; because I have always loved historical novels, and because the author of these historical novels was so lauded. I have come across many readers who read and re-read her books, and I have a very clear memory of a bookish television, some years ago, where I saw an author speaking so articulately of how she and her husband would eagerly await publication of each new book, and read aloud to each other.<br /><br />I was sure that I would love them, but I hesitated to start reading because there were so many thick books, because I heard they were filled with complex plots, and a wealth of abstruse literary and historical allusions.<br /><br />In the end though, the arguments for reading became overwhelming.<br /><br />I picked up the first book, and now I can tell you that I loved it.<br /><br />It was complex, I’m quite sure there were things I missed, I wasn’t always entirely sure what was going on, but none of that mattered. I was captivated, I had to keep turning the pages, and it was lovely to be able to listen to someone so much cleverer than me, who was so articulate, who had so much to say about a subject that she loved, talking at very great length …<br /><br /><br /><br />The story opens in Scotland, in the 1540s.<br /><br />The king’s widow, Mary of Guise, rules the country as regent for her infant daughter, who the world will come to know as Mary Queen of Scots. England has a boy king, Edward VI, and his realm is governed by the Lord Protector. He wants the Queen of Scots to be the bride of his King, so that he will rule over the whole of island of Great Britain. His troops are making forays into Scotland, and some of the Lords of that country are inclined to throw their lots in with the English. The rulers of the great European powers are watching, eager to see what will happen, and thinking how that might benefit, what they might do to steers events.<br /><br />That’s an interesting point in history that I hadn’t considered too much, I don’t remember finding in fiction before, and it was lovely to follow a story in that period, so richly evoked.<br /><br />That story was sparked by the dramatic return from exile of Francis Crawford of Lymond: the younger son of a noble family, a lover of wit and game-playing, and a former galley-slave. It gradually became clear that he was on a mission to prove himself innocent of a six-year-old charge of treason, that he believed that one of three distinguished Englishmen held the key to the success or failure of that mission, but that to have any chance of success he must avoid a great many interested parties who want to take him captive – or worse.<br /><br />That’s as much as I can say about specifics of the plot.<br /><br />That plot is labyrinthine; and as I found my way through that labyrinth I saw so many different scenes, and I realised that there were so many different aspects to this story; there were twists and turns, shocks and revelations, tragedy and comedy, high drama and quiet reflection. Some things became clear, other things remained opaque, and often it was revealed that things were not as they seemed at all.<br /><br />The construction was so clever, and I loved that there were so many small details that could have slipped by unnoticed but would prove to be vitally important.<br /><br />The depth and the complexity of the characterisation is extraordinary; and a cast populated by fictional characters and historical figures lived and breathed.<br /><br />The world that they lived in is as well evoked; and I loved the cinematic sweep as well as perfectly framed close-ups. There is so a wealth of detail that makes up the bigger picture, and I could see no flaw in it; everything felt real and everything felt right.<br /><br />The use of language is wonderful, and the love of language is clear; it may be too much for some in Lymond’s verbal flourishes, but I loved them and I think that anyone with a love of words, anyone who regrets that some many lovely words in the English language are underused, would love them too.<br /><br />The success or failure of this book though, rested firmly on the shoulders of its central character. Francis Crawford of Lymond could be infuriating, but he had such charisma that I had to follow his story. He is incomparable, and the nearest I can come to any sort of comparison is to say that if you can imagine that the Count of Monte Christo had not been an honest sailor but an educated, cultured player of games …<br /><br />It took a little time for him to grow on me. I realised that there was a lot of back story to account for the way he chose to make his entrance, the ridiculous risks he took, the terrible antipathy between him and his elder brother; but even taking all of that into his account there were times when he struck me as juvenile and spoilt.<br /><br />As the story progressed though, he seemed to become more mature, and I came to realise that his history had left him damaged and deeply troubled. His relationship with one particular woman swung me completely to his side, even though I still wasn’t entirely sure where right and wrong lay in this story.<br /><br />As events unfolded I became more and more involved, and though I didn’t want the story to end I did want to know how it would end.<br /><br />That this is the first book in a series gave me a clue, and how I envy those readers who found this book when it was first published who didn’t even have that one small clue.<br /><br />Dorothy Dunnett played fair, but oh how clever she was. The drama kept on coming, even after a dramatic shift into a courtroom, and it was only at the very end of the book that I could stop, draw breath, and realise what an extraordinary journey this book had been.<br /><br />There is so much that could be said, and I feel that I’ve barely scratched the surface.<br /><br />I understand now why so many people love this series of books, have read and re-read them, have written at length.<br /><br />I’d love to do the same, I wish I’d started sooner, and now it’s time I started reading the next book.<br />',\n",

       "   'text': \"Back in the late 1950's (the book was published in 1961!!!!) Dorothy Dunnett confided to her husband that she could find nothing to read. Said husband suggested that she write a book that she herself would like to read. (Because that's what husband do - haha!)But, THANK YOU - THANK YOU!!!! Sir Alastair Dunnett, because without your suggestion there might never have been written The Game of Kings; the first book in a series of 6 books jointly referred to as the Lymond Chronicles. In my opinion THE BEST BOOKS ever written - series or not. It is classical literature, and it is not an easy read, nor is it meant to be! Dunnett doesn't hold your hand or make exceptions for one's lack of languages, the classics, etc.<br /><br />I personally have never been on a more breathtaking, awe inspiring, emotional journey while reading in my 52 years. I have never read a series of books that each time they're re-read brings to me more detail, scope, understanding, and LAYERS of the story. Human characters that you love, you hate, you care about; and not just the main characters, but all the characters because Dunnett makes them ALL come alive. Then add the background. The detail of Renaissance Europe, and the Ottoman Empire which draws you in through her writing as though you, the reader are actually there experiencing it. The best, most accurate sort of history lesson you can imagine wrapped into and around the fictional stories themselves.<br /><br />I hope you take a chance and read The Game of Kings, and I hope you LOVE it! If you do, and decide to read the series (READ IT!), then hold onto your hat, your heart, and your stomach. You are in for the literary ride of your life! These books are wonderous, magnificent, unforgettable!!!!!!<br /><br /><br />I love these books+\",\n",

       "   'text': 'Top quality historical fiction. I can honestly say that this book had me enthralled from beginning to end, both times I’ve read it now. In fact it’s probably even better the second time around. <br /><br />Usually with a book of this size and calibre I find myself finished within a day or two. With Lymond however it’s serves you better to take it slow. I’ve mentioned in other reviews that I am dyslexic. Well this book is set in 1540’s Scotland and speech is mostly written in the way that it is spoken, accent and all. It’s a heavy undertaking without taking into account that the main character Lymond is a polyglot, and constantly slips in and out of different languages. He quotes ancient philosophy, plays, poems and all types of dramatic prose. In fact 90% of what comes out of his mouth is quoting someone or something else. His entire persona is theatrics and he always knows what to say and what role to play. So as you can imagine it is very difficult to read and make sense of. But once you get the flow and learn to listen to what Lymond is saying, things start to fall into place. He’s like watching a magician. You know you’re being tricked, you just can’t tell at what part he started tricking you. That being said, if you are reading the book and it’s not infuriating you, you might not be reading it closely or slowly enough. It is such a clever book and Francis is such a clever man. This is how you write an intelligent character. So many books have supposedly smart characters, but you are just told they are smart. Dunnett makes it immediately clear that Francis is ridiculously intelligent and makes no shy game of throwing that fact at you every time he is on the page. <br /><br />He’s one of my favourite characters, he encapsulates some of my favourite traits while being very unique. His lightning fast wit and wicked barbed tongue bring his dramatic and theatrical speeches down on his foes like a ton of bricks. I would hate to be on the receiving end of his verbal lashings. He is fantastically clever and the master of double dealings, feints, and secrets. He acting or playing a part almost of the time, and when he is showing his real self no one believes it. He is isolated whilst being beloved by his followers. He is condemned and judged by everyone. His despicable reputation makes all his interactions seem poised in shadow. <br />But there is a angelic quality to this butter haired rogue. There is a tender side, and a part of him that wants to do the right thing. Towards the end of the novel you see a much more vulnerable side to Francis. He’s hurt and almost out of options, yet he still doesn’t truly let the act drop. <br />I think what makes him the most interesting is that we never actually read from his POV. We aren’t in his head so we see everything from the rest of the colourful cast. I can see why, knowing how the trick is done ruins the fun. <br />We follow many different characters and see the plot spinning out from many different sides. I really enjoyed this aspect of the story as it made me root for pretty much all the sides at one point or another. It was great to see Lymond’s theatrics from the point of view of his foes. You never really know what Lymond has planned and he surprised me on countless occasions. You know he’s going to do something ridiculous that only he could pull off. Not only that, but some of his greatest feats in the book are executed flawlessly whilst he is incredibly intoxicated. <br />I’d also like to scream about the fact that he is 21 at the start of this book! <br />So yeah. I’m in love, obviously. <br /><br />It terms of plot I don’t want to say much at all. Just know that this is a book of secrets and lies. Political intrigue is a heavy focus as is strategy and mind games. If you don’t like these things in your historical fiction then you probably won’t enjoy this book. There is a handy list of everyone at the front of the book which is very useful as there is a large cast of characters and it is a little difficult to follow who is who at some points. Especially early on. History is also a major focus. The book uses real historical people and events and basically inputs the Crawford family right in the middle of it. But all the characters felt like they had purpose and real impact on the events that were taking place. The Crawford family and it’s dynamics are one of my favourite fictional family’s. They are all distinguished from one another and you really get the sense that they know how to wind each other up. <br /><br />I really wish more people would give this a go. Even just this first book. You could definitely read this first book as a stand-alone. However you may well find yourself falling for Lymond too. <br /><br />When I last read book 2 I remember that I didn’t like it as much but I’m hoping I’ll like it better this time around. I know what I’m getting into at least.',\n",

       "   'text': 'Wow.<br /><br />I hadn\\'t done that in a while. Staying up all night with a book is a pleasure when you have the morning to sleep in, not when your alarm rings before you\\'ve read the last page and you still haven\\'t gone to bed. Last time I stayed up with a book - to the last page of a book - was in March, with (who\\'d have guessed?) <a href=\"https://goodreads.com/book/show/9305362.Captive_Prince__Captive_Prince___1_\" title=\"Captive Prince (Captive Prince, #1) by C.S. Pacat\" rel=\"noopener\">Captive Prince: Volume One</a> and <a href=\"https://goodreads.com/book/show/17158513.Captive_Prince_Volume_Two__Captive_Prince___2_\" title=\"Captive Prince Volume Two (Captive Prince, #2) by C.S. Pacat\" rel=\"noopener\">Captive Prince: Volume Two</a>.<br /> <br />June is a busy month I should not be spending reading fiction, which is one reason I was keeping a moderate pace with this novel. So, assuming I had (have, it\\'s morning already) lots to study, I decided to go to bed last night relatively early and read just a scene - sort of a chapter. It didn\\'t really work out that way. <br /><br /><br />Now, the book.<br /><br />The best novels surprise me at every turn. I expect something to happen, or in a certain way, but what really happens is unexpected and much better. :D Or worse.<br /><br />At times I thought Lymond didn\\'t have as good control over people as I was being led to believe. I had two examples - Will and Mariotta. When you wind a spring too tightly, it\\'s bound to snap eventually, and in the wrong direction. But I was disabused of this train of thought by later appeared information and the characters\\' personalities.<br /><br />Some characters I wished would drop dead <input type=\"checkbox\" class=\"spoiler__control\" aria-label=\"The following text has been marked spoiler.

Others I\\'d like to know better - Johnnie, Sybilla, Molly, Gideon. Richard. Lymond, duh.<br /><br />My thoughts are not organised nor complete. I\\'ll come back later to add and/or edit.

It's not an easy book to get into, I guess, with all the literary references (in many languages!) and the history and language in general. This book abused my poor dictionary -- I swear I came across words I didn't know on every single page of this book. I gave up trying to look things up after page 30. But I enjoyed it nonetheless. <br /><br />I hear that there's a companion to the series, and it's probably worthwhile to look it up one of these days, but probably after I finish reading the series. \",\n",

       "   'text': \"I haven't quite finished, but feel the need to write some thoughts down. Will finish later. At first, I didn't quite know what to make of this book. It's written in a sort of antique English brogue with frequent French and old English spellings that are hard to read. I have mostly skimmed the parts I don't understand, being basically lazy, but when something was necessary for me to understand what was being said, I used Google, the ubiquitous explainer without which I could not live. I frequently wondered if it was worth all the effort, as it was initially very unclear where the plot was going. The first vignette is quite promising, however, being fairly comic and interesting if convoluted.... about a drunken pig and being smuggled into the country... the story progresses with one vignette or chapter after the other winding a circuitous route around the main character, a dashing, handsome, brilliant, and irrepressible noble by the name of Francis Crawford of Lymond, Master of Culter.<br /><br />As I waded through a bewildering array of scenarios and characters, I gradually became enthralled. I am now almost finished and while reading this afternoon, I found myself responding to the story in a visceral way and realized that Ms. Dunnett had quite magically wound the story around my emotions, pulling them out and into a great knot in my stomach as I wondered how Lymond was going to survive; knowing he would as there are five more books, my heart torn asunder by his battle with his brother, Richard. Now, on the cusp of being finished, I am already sad that this sometimes exasperating and exhausting journey is almost at an end.<br /><br />I am finished and have little to add, except the ending was most satisfactory. The hero is complicated and intelligent and the ideas and thinking are quite deep and profound. I am quite satisfied and am extremely glad I made the effort of reading it. Now, I think I will indulge in a little lightweight fantasy of Chicagoland Vampires and when in my car or walking my dogs, will listen to A Clash of Kings.\",\n",

       "   'text': 'I finished this book, after many delays (two months\\' worth!), on Saturday. And you know what? I\\'m going right back in for a reread. I underestimated this book or, at least, I was focusing on the wrong things. There were layers I wasn\\'t even aware of and now I\\'m heading back in to catch all the clues I missed. I\\'ll rate this when I\\'m done with my reread. :-)<br /><br />ETA: Finished third reading 1/28/2022.<br /><br /><b>\"Such a man is Crawford of Lymond: such a man this land may pray never to see again in the difficult ways of her history. I say: busy yourself no longer about him, for he is better condemned, and most harshly dead.\"</b><br /><br />After a five year absence, Francis Crawford of Lymond steps back onto the Scottish homeland that has branded him a murderer and a traitor. He does so for reasons of his own but they are reasons that the author masterfully plays out against the backdrop of history. It’s a time of great unrest for Scotland, caught between France and England who each want Scotland’s child queen for their own. Although Lymond and his family are fictitious, they bump up against a plethora of actual historical figures and it makes for a marvelous mix. <br /> <br />I’ve read this book three times in the last eight months so that should tell you something about how much I love it. I could happily sit down and start it all over again from the beginning because each time I read it I tease out a new, previously missed, connection. It’s not a book that will appeal to everyone, of course. What book does? But this one is likely hampered by the speech patterns of its main character, himself. Lymond has a manner of speaking that can be off-putting to many. He’s constantly making obscure literary and classical references and one could spend hours just trying to chase them all down on Google (it’s not necessary, so don’t do it unless you’re just really wanting to expand your knowledge of medieval arts and humanities). Take his very first line, for example:<br /><br /><i>\"I am a narwhal looking for my virgin. I have sucked up the sea like Charybdis and failing other entertainment will spew it three times daily, for a fee.\"</i><br /><br />It’s enough to make one throw the book across the room in exasperation – and, in fact, another prominent character in the story does eventually call Lymond out for not speaking in plain speech like a normal person. But there is a method to the madness and those who hang in there through the bumpy parts will be rewarded with a story full of court intrigue, double dealings, betrayals, loyalties, sword fights, romance, and some truly excellent verbal zingers. It has a seemingly slow start but then the author starts to peel back the layers and the tension starts to mount until, finally, I, at least, could not put it down. Not even on my third read.',\n",

       "   'text': \"Prerequisites for this book: an extensive knowledge of 16th-century history, focusing on France, England and Scotland; a passible knowledge of French, Spanish, Latin and some Italian, or a good online translator; solid idea of chess strategies, beyond just knowing what the pieces are called; the ability to read olde tymey speling wythote going madde; and lots and lots of patience. And a notebook. Seriously. I really should've used one myself.<br /><br />You know when you eat something new for the first time and you can't tell if you like it or not, and each new bite just makes it more and more unclear? That was me and this book.<br /><br />I'm giving this three stars for the author's effort that she clearly put into this. I can appreciate that amount of hard work and dedication, and I can certainly appreciate the unique flavor and structure that it gave this novel, which is quite unlike anything I've ever read before and really sets it apart from nearly every other historical novel on the market today. It also has the single funniest scene I've read in a long while, and I'll forever mourn the medieval buddy-cop dramedy that never was.<br /><br />But I just could never sink into the story. The prose was overly wordy and had shades of purple, and much of the story was told in third-person objective, so you could only guess what the characters were thinking most of the time and motivations were largely a mystery. This was clearly done to keep the reader in the dark, but it prevented me from caring about much of what was going on. There were a few strange occurrences of third-person limited sprinkled here and there, but those only further threw me out of the story. I liked some of the characters well enough but never felt connected to them either, so I had trouble caring one way or another what happened to them, Lymond included. And I could never figure out if this needed more showing and less telling or more telling and less showing. <br /><br />It did get much easier to read as I went along. It started out very arch and formal and slowly relaxed (but not too much) into a more approachable tone. The prologue was the most difficult, and if you can get through that, you should be able to make it through the rest of the book. However, by the end of this it was pretty obvious where this was all heading, and I got impatient with all the wordy words and I did skip/skim a few paragraphs here and there in the last 50 pages or so just to get to the point already. <br /><br />This is obviously a book you'd get a lot more out of it the second or third time around, but I can't see myself ever reading this again, unfortunately. Once was most definitely enough.\",\n",

       "   'text': \"Complex, confounding, mesmerising.<br />The story opens with a man returning to his homeland from exile. He is a disgraced aristocrat with a terrible reputation, an outlaw, a traitor, “the devil incarnate”. Other than that we know little about him. We have no idea what he is done or what is motivation might be but he quickly sets about causing havoc. Breaking into noble homes in broad daylight, intimidating the occupants and stealing their valuables, even callously attacking his own mother in her home. He puts himself in the way of trouble,danger and appears recklessly out of control. He is cold, cruel and vindictive, he behaves appallingly when drunk and worse when he is sober. He steals, bullies, cheats and insults, but he does it all with such style, such wit.<br />Amongst these thrilling raids, labyrinthine political intrigue and daring escapes, the plot is slowly being teased out and we begin to realise there is more to this brutal antihero than is first apparent. The unraveling of this complex character kept me hooked right to the end.<br /><br />The writing style is unashamedly dense with historical detail, the atmosphere of the period is painstakingly created. The language is complex and difficult, littered with quotations in many languages and references to classical and early European mythology and politics. The writer uses these to a large degree to create a distinctive voice for her main character, It is clear when he is talking, even if not made explicit in the text, by the way he uses language, as a weapon, to confuse and obscure his true purpose as well as to wound. It<br />often has a similar effect on the reader as on the victim (reading on the kindle is useful as you are only a tap away from a Wikipedia or dictionary definition, although, often, Lynmond confounds both of these). I did find the book challenging and infuriating at first, until I got into the rhythm of it, there is no need to understand every reference, just because you can't breathe underwater it doesn’t mean you shouldn't swim. Once you get past this, the writing is mesmeric, it makes you slow down, it demands your focused attention, you cannot skip lightly over the pages. It gets right inside your head.<br /><br />Don't be misled, though, this book is no dry historical epic, it is thoroughly entertaining. You are never far away from a joke, something shocking, something scurrilous. Lynmond's madcap adventures rattle along with breathtaking speed. This book is anything but dull.<br /><br />This is the best book I have read all year, I have never come across anything like it before. It was exhausting but rewarding to read and I have thought of little else for the past week.\",\n",

       "   'text': 'I have to confess that at the very beginning of this novel, I was less than impressed. The true nature of the conflict and the motivations of the characters were well-hidden, and the reader was left somewhat puzzled as to where this story was going. This confusion was complicated by the multiple names/titles each individual had. At times the same character would be referred to by his given name, by his family name, by the name of his manor, or by his title. <br /><br />After this slow start, however, the reader began to be sucked into the plot. The onion analogy is somewhat overused in literary circles, but it fits this novel -- layer after layer was peeled away chapter by chapter, and the reader began to see the immense richness the plot has to offer.<br /><br />The author also did a great job in encompassing us in a very believable setting that matched 16th century Scotland quite well. From an historical fiction standpoint, <i>Game of Kings</i> is on a level of with the likes of <a href=\"https://goodreads.com/book/show/5043.The_Pillars_of_the_Earth__The_Pillars_of_the_Earth___1_\" title=\"The Pillars of the Earth (The Pillars of the Earth, #1) by Ken Follett\" rel=\"noopener\"> Pillars of the Earth</a> or <a href=\"https://goodreads.com/book/show/1853145.Sarum_The_Novel_of_England\" title=\"Sarum The Novel of England by Edward Rutherfurd\" rel=\"noopener\"> Sarum</a>. <br /><br />Finally, the protagonist becomes a truly legendary figure -- a person who can be courteous and condescending, pugilistic and peaceful, and cunning and caring at the same time is one worthy of future exploits. I look forward to reading the next novel in this series.',\n",

       "   'text': \"Re-read 8/3/08. Historical novel set in 16th century Scotland and England (later books in the series range farther afield). Francis Crawford of Lymond returns to Scotland in despite a charge of treason hanging over his head and sets up a band of outlaws that causes havoc for forces on both sides of the English-Scottish war. The first 100 pages or so are a bit slow, though things get much better after that. Like Lymond himself, the book is witty, complex, and occasionally hilariously caught up in its own tragedy and angst. Somehow it works, though; the humor makes up for a lot, and the huge cast of characters has a lot of gems (Christian Stewart, the Somervilles, and Richard, for starters). Lymond himself is in many ways the fictional descendant of Peter Wimsey and the Scarlet Pimpernel; he often infuriates me, but his story is never boring.<br /><br />The slow start is less of a problem upon re-reading. First, I know it improves, and second, I can see how Dunnett sets the groundwork for later events in this book and the rest of the series. I wish I could get more of the references (one would have to be very erudite to get all of them!), but the book's enjoyable enough even if you miss a few (or many) along the way.<br /><br />\",\n",

       "   'text': '<b>A CHALLENGING READ </b> <br /><br />This book requires some work to get through. So if you want easy reading, best to bypass this.<br /><br />That said, if you like a reading challenge, this is well worth the effort. (I do. I’m one of those weird people that enjoyed books like <a href=\"https://goodreads.com/book/show/338798.Ulysses\" title=\"Ulysses by James Joyce\" rel=\"noopener\"> Ulysses</a>, <a href=\"https://goodreads.com/book/show/6759.Infinite_Jest\" title=\"Infinite Jest by David Foster Wallace\" rel=\"noopener\"> Infinite Jest</a>, <a href=\"https://goodreads.com/book/show/24800.House_of_Leaves\" title=\"House of Leaves by Mark Z.

So please skip this review if you haven’t read the book and want to avoid spoilers.</b><br /><br /><b>REFERENCES NEEDED, ESPECIALLY FOR SCOTS DIALECT</b><br /><br />Unless you’re familiar with the Scottish dialect and Old French, you’ll need to arm yourself with references (both websites and books). I list a few at the end of this review.<br /><br /><b>THANK YOU GOODREADERS</b><br /><br />I’m late to the party with this series. (This book, the first of <a href=\"https://goodreads.com/book/show/112077.The_Game_of_Kings__The_Lymond_Chronicles___1_\" title=\"The Game of Kings (The Lymond Chronicles, #1) by Dorothy Dunnett\" rel=\"noopener\"> The Lymond Chronicles</a>, was first published in 1961 (although the version I read was a 2019 revision). I discovered this by reading reviews posted by Goodreads friends. I’m very grateful to them for highlighting this gem.<br /><br /><b>MY FAVORITE (READING) THINGS</b><br /><br />This book combines several of my reading interests. It takes place in the period right after the Middle Ages (which used to be called the Renaissance, but is now labelled “The Early Modern Era”. I’m fascinated by any time period which falls in the Middle Ages or the era just afterwards. I also love to read any novel taking place in Scotland. Add to this mix plenty of accurate details of the history and literature of the time, a compelling story line, fascinating and complex characters, and lyrical writing and you’ve got me hooked.<br /><br /><b>THE MOTHER OF SWORD AND SORCERY</b><br /><br />I’m a lifelong and ardent fantasy fan. So I was astonished to discover that the roots of many of the sword and sorcery novels (and other works of fantasy) are in this book, although this is NOT a fantasy, but a historical novel (and a very historically accurate one, by all accounts).<br /><br /><a href=\"https://goodreads.com/author/show/346732.George_R_R__Martin\" title=\"George R.R. Martin\" rel=\"noopener\"> George R.R. Martin</a> obviously got the title <a href=\"https://goodreads.com/book/show/13496.A_Game_of_Thrones__A_Song_of_Ice_and_Fire___1_\" title=\"A Game of Thrones (A Song of Ice and Fire, #1) by George R.R. Martin\" rel=\"noopener\"> Game of Thrones</a> from this book, which was published about 45 years before his. <a href=\"https://goodreads.com/author/show/3617.Diana_Gabaldon\" title=\"Diana Gabaldon\" rel=\"noopener\"> Diana Gabaldon</a> was clearly influenced by this book in her <a href=\"https://goodreads.com/book/show/10964.Outlander__Outlander___1_\" title=\"Outlander (Outlander, #1) by Diana Gabaldon\" rel=\"noopener\"> Outlander</a> time travel series, although this book gives a more well balanced view of Scotland and Scots (In <a href=\"https://goodreads.com/book/show/112077.The_Game_of_Kings__The_Lymond_Chronicles___1_\" title=\"The Game of Kings (The Lymond Chronicles, #1) by Dorothy Dunnett\" rel=\"noopener\"> The Lymond Chronicles</a> Scotsmen aren’t just hyper masculine hunks, but all types of people). Gabaldon probably even got her famous “Sassenach” from this. (Young Will Scott, playing cards with an English prisoner, exclaims, <br />“<i>if you’ve any pins holding up your breeks you’d best watch them, because I’ll have them skint off the superior Sassenach dowp o’ ye before another day dawns</i>”). <a href=\"https://goodreads.com/author/show/11889.Ellen_Kushner\" title=\"Ellen Kushner\" rel=\"noopener\"> Ellen Kushner</a> certainly got the germ of her <a href=\"https://goodreads.com/book/show/68485.Swordspoint__Riverside___1_\" title=\"Swordspoint (Riverside, #1) by Ellen Kushner\" rel=\"noopener\"> Swordspoint</a> series from <a href=\"https://goodreads.com/book/show/112077.The_Game_of_Kings__The_Lymond_Chronicles___1_\" title=\"The Game of Kings (The Lymond Chronicles, #1) by Dorothy Dunnett\" rel=\"noopener\"> The Lymond Chronicles</a>. Someone quipped that not many people read these books, but they all wrote novels. (See that reference in this Guardian article here: <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" href=\"https://amp.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2017/oct/19/dorothy-dunnetts-lymond-chronicles-far-more-than-sex-and-swords\">https://amp.theguardian.com/books/boo...</a>)<br /><br />Anyway, this book has been around for so long that I’m not sure I can say much about it that hasn’t already been said.<br /><br /><b>MAIN CHARACTER: HERO OR ANTI-HERO?</b><br /><br />Our central character is the peculiar and multi-talented Francis Crawford of Lymond, usually referred to as simply Lymond. To say he’s complex is the understatement of the millennium. He’s a brigand and a murderer, but also an expert swordsman and warrior, a very brainy scholar, an apt quoter of literature, poetry, philosophy, and myth; sharp and accurate judge of character, a polyglot and polymath, a legal mind to rival any lawyer’s, a Renaissance man, and an accomplished athlete. He’s strikingly good looking to boot. He’s generally assumed to be a traitor and a criminal. He served time on French galleys (“forced labor”…basically slavery as a punishment). For much of the book he comes across as a conceited, self serving, arrogant, manipulative cruel, sharp tongued know it all. But then we find out there’s more to him.<br /><br /><b>SECONDARY CHARACTERS</b><br /><br />His brother, Lord Richard Crawford, is obsessed with bringing Lymond to justice for his crimes, while Lymond himself is obsessed with clearing his name.<br /><br />There are a number of interesting secondary characters. One of my favorites was Sybilla Crawford (“The Dowager”), Lymond’s mother. It’s clear that Lymond got his brains from her, as she proves to be not only devoted to her children, but very wise and exceedingly shrewd. English POW Gideon Somerville, and his wife, Kate, were both intelligent and kind. I also liked Christian Stewart, the blind, redheaded goddaughter of Lady Fleming who managed her property Bog Hall. Richard Crawford is shown to be a good man in the end, although both he and Lymond certainly seem like villains through much of the book.<br /><br /><b>HISTORICAL FIGURES</b><br /><br />Several actual historical figures appear in the story, including:<br /><br />. Mary Queen of Scots as a child (“The Baby Queen”)<br /><br /> . Mary of Guise (Marie de Guise, “The Dowager Queen”), the French mother of baby Mary<br /><br />. Lady Janet “Jenny” Fleming, Scottish mistress of the French king. <br /><br />. Sir Thomas Wharton, First Baron Wharton, an <br /> English military commander who was one of the <br /> Wardens of Scotland for the English crown<br /><br />. William Grey, 13th Baron Grey de Wilton, Wharton’s <br /> counterpart<br /><br />. The loud mouthed and tactless Scot Sir Walter “Wat” <br /> Scott of Buccleuch.<br /><br /><b>COMPELLING STORY</b><br /><br />Anyway, Lymond and those around him go through a series of amazing adventures during a nasty war in which the English attempt to conquer Scotland. But their Scottish foes frequently outwit the stodgy English invaders. (It reminds me of today’s war between the Ukrainians and Russia). Sometimes those adventures prove fatal for those associated with Lymond.<br /><br /><b>BEAUTIFUL WRITING</b><br /><br /><a href=\"https://goodreads.com/author/show/8361.Dorothy_Dunnett\" title=\"Dorothy Dunnett\" rel=\"noopener\"> Dorothy Dunnett’s</a> writing is often beautiful and poetic, although it never overwhelms the compelling story. Here’s a sample:<br /><br /> <i> The river wound its way dimly to the coast; and the estuary, flat and moon-bright, with small ships black as buttons on its surface, lay at the bottom of the sky and rolled in the east-by-east wind which with spare and racking fingers was withdrawing the coasts from the English fleet.</i><br /><br /><b>NOT QUITE A 5</b><br /><br />I enjoyed this a lot. But I couldn’t give it a perfect 5. For one thing, I found the final scenes a bit incredible even by the standards of this story, which stretched credulity all along, but managed to keep me believing in it until the vaguely unsatisfactory ending. I also found myself slightly confused at times, in spite of consulting multiple references as I read. This book may be worth rereading.<br /><br /><b>A LIST OF REFERENCES</b><br /><br />Here’s a list of references:<br /><br /><b>The Ultimate Guide to Dorothy Dunett’s The Game of Kings</b>. (This book is on Goodreads, but I couldn’t get the Goodreads book link to work). Useful and available free on Kindle Unlimited. However, it did not explain all uses of Scottish. I also thought the information on shamanism was “meh”. So-so on the Tarot also, although I did not know that at the time the Tarot was used as a regular deck of cards in card games. But still, overall a very useful reference.<br /><br /><a href=\"https://goodreads.com/book/show/112076.The_Dorothy_Dunnett_Companion\" title=\"The Dorothy Dunnett Companion by Elspeth Morrison\" rel=\"noopener\"> The Dorothy Dunnett Companion</a>. I did not use this, as it was not available on Kindle and I didn’t feel like waiting weeks for the physical book at my library.

       "   'text': 'THE GAME OF KINGS (Historical Novel – non-mystery) – Ex<br />Dorothy Dunnett – 1st of series<br />In 1547 Francis Crawford of Lymond returns to his native Scotland, which is threatened by an English invasion and the bloody rivalries of its nobles. Accused of treason, hunted by friend and enemy alike, he leads a company of outlaws in a desperate race to redeem his reputation, even at the cost of his life.<br />***This is a superb series filled with action, intrigue, humor, tragedy, war, romance and, yes, a bit of mystery. Dunnett’s research into the period was unparallel. This, the first book, is a bit difficult to get into, which is why I obtained the unabridged audiobook from my library and listened to it while commuting, but well worth the effort. She does use a lot of foreign phrases, which can make the reader a bit frustrated, but one can either pass over them and not lose the effect of the story, join the Game of Kings group on Yahoo, or look them up either themselves or in Elpeth Morrison’s “Companion” books. If you’re looking for a break from mysteries and love history, this is a marvelous alternative.<br />',\n",

Aber der Held, der Held. Mit 14 wäre ich wahrscheinlich begeistert gewesen, denn Lymond kann einfach alles, ist polyglott, sieht super aus, erträgt alle Schikanen mit übermenschlicher Selbstbeherrschung, allenfalls wird er ein bisschen blass dabei, aber ich bin nicht mehr 14 und oh fuck off. Ich glaube, mich stört dabei vor allem, dass die Welt des Buchs und wahrscheinlich auch der Autorin eine ist, in der solche Helden verehrt werden, jede Konversation ein Dominanzspektakel ist und dieser Kampf vor allem durch das Aufeinanderstapeln von literarischen Zitaten geführt wird.',\n",

I know this is considered a classic and it was strongly recommended by my friend, Linda, so I tried - really tried - to enjoy it but it just isn’t for me. I didn’t like the main character, Lymond. He is purely fictitious and is a cross between Cap’n Jack Sparrow and Oscar Wilde with a bit of Errol Flynn as Captain Blood thrown in for good measure. I just found him irritating, particularly the ridiculously flowery language he speaks in all the time. For me, he lacks credibility.

       "   'text': 'I don\\'t often post reviews of books I haven\\'t finished, but I\\'ve altogether too much to say about this one.<br /><br /><i>Game of Kings</i> works best read as a 16th-century-set pisstake of adventures like <i>The Scarlet Pimpernel</i>, and in the same way that the more knowing scenes of james Bond films are meant to both satirical and serious. (Thanks to <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1528054793\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Alison\\'s review</a> for signposting me to this way of looking at it.) This is a great approach for a swashbuckling historical adventure story to take, and when readers totally fail to \\'get\\' Dunnett, I think this is something they are missing. <br /><br />But that doesn\\'t mean it\\'s all good as far as I\\'m concerned - otherwise I\\'d have saved this post until I\\'d finished the book. <br /><br />This is a deeply nerdy novel in both the good and bad senses. It is often meticulous in its scholarship. And its tongue-in-cheek attitude has an affinity with a certain sort of so-bad-its-good culture that I associate with female nerds. (Among friends in the late 90s, for example, this included the US soap <i>Sunset Beach</i>, Hammer Horror, and obscure vintage non-fiction by authors with unfortunate double-entendre names. My own enjoyment of the first and the third was negligible, though I would sometimes perform amusement with these things to maintain friendship.) <br /><br />Dunnett overuses research to an extent that outstrips any examples of research-dumping I\\'ve seen in more recent literary fiction (e.g. too many items in a list: “<i>I suppose he might manage if he sticks like Lindsay to the vulgarities in iambics; but if he’s developing into a Calvinist or a Lutheran or an Erasmian or an Anabaptist it isn’t very healthy.</i>\" Normal conversational rhythm says you just need two of those to convey meaning, and in any case an Erasmian is not much like the others.) Some metaphors, often overusing research or other general knowledge, are so inept I cringed. These may involve something era-specific that\\'s wildly out of place, such as describing a stealthy swimmer as an oriflamme - or scholarly information that would have been unknown to characters talking or thinking about it, such as an analogy to a prehistoric sea-scorpion, or an implied fully modern understanding of how \"unicorn horns\" were actually from narwhals. (That was not the point that the Elizabethan Sir Humphrey Gilbert reached in suggesting a horn was from a \\'sea-unicorn\\'). Obscurity is needlessly overdone (\"Wild Jagd\" for \"Wild Hunt\", for example): like caricature roleplaying nerds who speak in cod-medieval English because it\\'s their idea of cool … There\\'s a sense of not knowing quite where to stop, and a lack of awareness of what works in the setting among those more sensitive to social or fictional conventions. Though this may also be about not caring for the opinions of those who aren\\'t on the same wavelength. <br /><br />But if someone like me - a geek who was obsessed with Tudor history from the ages of about 4 to my early twenties, and who had an even more obsessive crush on the Scarlet Pimpernel when aged about 13, and who took French, Spanish and Latin at school - isn\\'t on Dunnett\\'s wavelength, who the bloody hell is? I want to ask. Except thousands evidently are, and I am mystified by the idea of a mindset that would get the references yet be unbothered by or unaware of the ineptness. (Although her fans include two GR friends I talk to quite regularly in comments and who are among the people whose reviews I like most frequently.) Dunnett\\'s fandom seems to be of just that size which makes one a cult author, neither extremely obscure and out of print nor wildly popular, yet unknown to many readers - and readers who are fans tend to be avid ones.<br /><br />If Dunnett\\'s terrible metaphors and research dumping are meant, themselves, to be satire, for me it\\'s all too tedious to be amusing - and the humour is so unmarked, compared to the glowing beacons in the text which are Lymond\\'s swoonworthy innuendo-laden witticisms, that they make the book that unfortunate type of satire which is too easily mistaken for a serious example of its target. <br /><br />The book can also come across as a deliberate attempt at camp, and if an author is not themselves camp, such a thing may be intermittently successful, at best. (Though does this depend on precisely how one perceives camp? The love-or-hate reactions to Dunnett remind me a little of those to the even-more-cult author Ronald Firbank; there are people who <i>definitely</i> know and love camp who don\\'t like Firbank.) Plenty of 1960s pop culture, especially in film, ended up being camp because of its ratio of exuberance to quality - and I think it\\'s possible that the 1960s-ness of this story and character is overlooked. The semi-serious spy spoof now seems like a very 60s genre, after all.<br /><br />Continuing the theme of nerdiness (and one also related to camp) the entire <i>Lymond Chronicles</i> series is about the sort of dashing badboy hero who was once swooned over by (among others) nerdy women, like awkward Anita Brookner heroines - and who in his more recent forms, still is by fanfiction writers. The cleverer of the latter also know he is an absurd figure even whilst he is hot, as Dunnett evidently does about Lymond. <br /><br />To all intents and purposes, the novel\\'s attributes make it like fanfiction for a hero the writer invented. It\\'s well enough written that it would be outstanding as free online content, but awkward enough that, when it\\'s an implied modern classic from a major publisher, one can cringe and wonder where the editor got to. After all, in the 1960s, they still did proper editing.<br /><br />Apparently, early fans imagined Peter O\\'Toole as Lymond - a superlative choice (I mean for almost anything, not just this) - and one can easily imagine an author being inspired by him to create Lymond, in a fanfic-like mode, as an imagined role for him. (Did Dunnett ever say if she was?) <br /><br />I am surprised the series has never been adapted for TV. The last couple of years haven\\'t been the right time for that - too much old-fashioned masculinity - but all the time from 1975-2015… how not? It would be fantastic to whittle away the more ridiculous prose, leaving the setting, plot and dialogue, and greatly preferable to wading through the novel. I can only assume, that if it\\'s not the Dunnett estate\\'s fault, the problem is that any adaptation would live or die by the casting of Lymond. It might be too much responsibility to get it right - and if exactly the right actor wasn\\'t interested, everyone\\'s done a lot of work for nothing much. But they managed it with <i>Poldark</i>. You\\'d also need to get an actor at the right point in his career that he wasn\\'t too expensive. (Current / younger Dunnett fans favour Tom Hiddleston, who\\'s definitely too big a star now. And I would say lacks the charisma and wit - Hiddleston\\'s characters are always frustrating echoes of what an actor with real presence could do - but this is clearly a minority opinion.)<br /><br /><br />When I first heard of Dorothy Dunnett, in the early 00s (so before the <i>Game of Thrones</i> TV adaptation meant this novel\\'s title needed a double-take) I thought it sounded perfect for me, given my knowledge of 16th century history, and because I also wasn\\'t feeling up to reading anything very heavy. I think I assumed I it would have the readability and learning of Terry Pratchett, albeit with fewer jokes and supernatural beings: the likes of me would get to feel smug about understanding references like \\'Lancre\\' - although that would be far from necessary to enjoy the story.<br /><br />However, the prose turned out to be denser than I expected; in general I didn\\'t take to it, was somewhat bored, and abandoned it probably in the first chapter. My attention was drawn back to it in September 2020 when a GR friend abandoned the book (a href=\"<a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/3520632571&quot;&gt;discussion\">https://www.goodreads.com/review/show...</a> here) and I saw Alison\\'s review as linked above. After a few weeks, I decided to have another go at the novel, and got further, but ... I\\'m sorry, but there is a difference between prose that is dense or ornate for good reasons, and this. (I mean, I like Huysmans, FFS, and Pynchon, and quite a few books others dismiss as having purple prose or being needlessly difficult.)<br /><br />And, this makes me a snob, and these days probably also structurally sexist, (though time and being a slow reader have a lot to do with it) but if I\\'m going to put in as much work and time that 500 pages of Dunnett\\'s prose would require, I want to be ticking off a prestigious classic found on lots of lists - something to which there are a lot more allusions in other books, and which has better conversation value. (Some GR reviewers are <i>calling</i> it a classic, but it\\'s not in Penguin Classics, is it? Or on many lists with greats of 20th century letters.) And if I\\'m making such an effort, it should be because I\\'m revelling in and marvelling at a book, as I did with Henry Fielding\\'s <i>Tom Jones</i>, or Pynchon\\'s <i>Mason &amp; Dixon</i>. Not for something where more than half my copious notes are nitpicking. (Now, <i>Mason &amp; Dixon</i>, there\\'s highly researched historical fiction well worth the effort. It\\'s both scholarly and witty, and superlatively written.)<br /><br />I feel like <i>Game of Kings</i> would have been a book suited to discovering in the library in days when your options were limited to libraries and high-street bookshops, and one would be delighted to find something more intelligent than the average historical potboiler. Or it would be something to read *after* one has already got through nearly all of the classics one wants to read.<br /><br />I\\'m obviously intrigued by this series regardless, as in early autumn 2020 I read several articles and blog posts about it, and thought of and wrote most of this post. But in terms of reading it is a frustrating neither-nor entity: neither light reading to relax with, nor a book that will get me the prestige and information value I expect from a more effortful read. In similar vein, <a href=\"https://www.academia.edu/3710936/Dubious_pleasures_Dorothy_Dunnett_and_the_historical_novel\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">This 1990 academic paper</a> on Dunnett said that the historical novel is \"neither high enough for autocritique nor low enough for thrills\". Though the writer evidently meant a certain sort of historical novel, as a few weeks before I finished this post, I read Ken Follett\\'s <i>Pillars of the Earth</i> which is absolutely thrilling, popular, and better researched than the sceptic might assume; I ate it at a rate of sometimes over 200 pages a day, unusual for me.<br /><br />Although I\\'d like to finish <i>Game of Kings</i> in theory, so I can have a better-informed opinion about it, I\\'m not sure where its neither-nor-ness and its ratio of effort to enjoyment would fit into my life and my reading schedule.<br /><br />Anyway, so far - as someone whose mind often inhabits that queerish space of \"would I rather be him or have him?\" and these days leans to the former increasingly often - there isn\\'t nearly enough of Lymond\\'s own POV. But there may be later, and that is among the limits to posting about books one hasn\\'t even read a quarter of, so I should leave it there.<br /><br />Though I do wonder if Dunnett might be to the taste of some GR friends who enjoy baroque prose and who usually stick to books presented as literary or experimental fiction.<br /><br />(November 2020)',\n",

       "   'text': 'Have you read the reviews for this book? It is almost universally loved. So I\\'m taking a different approach. <br /><br />Five reasons NOT to read <i>The Game Of Kings</i>:<br /><br />1) The author is clearly looking for intelligent readers who are willing to invest a little sweat for the big payoff. If you don\\'t like to work for your entertainment, DON\\'T READ THIS. If you don\\'t mind a little elbow grease, however, you will be well rewarded for your effort. Note: Even if you arm yourself with a decent dictionary (like the one that my Nook uses) you won\\'t find all the words Ms. Dunnett knows. If, on the other hand you are (or wish you were) a teacher of language skills, this book is the fulfillment of the assignment \"use this word in a sentence\". Wow, what skill this author has with vocabulary!<br /><br />2) Because of the similar title, you think this will be like <i>Game of Thrones</i> (see the similarity there?) by George R. R. Martin. This is not high fantasy. If that\\'s what you\\'re looking for, DON\\'T READ THIS. <i>Game of Thrones</i> has fantasy elements, plus political double-crossing, epic war scenes, spies and intrigue, non-stop questions about who\\'s good and who\\'s bad, incredible settings, medieval castles, violence, honor, love, hate, death, and direwolves. <i>The Game of Kings</i> doesn\\'t have fantasy elements. Or direwolves. The rest, it has in spades.<br /><br />3) You hate when authors throw in phrases and/or poetry in Olde English, French, Latin, Spanish, or other mysterious languages (how would I know?). This one does that. A lot. If that throws you off, DON\\'T READ THIS. Of course, you can ignore it and still move right along. Or you can slog through looking it all up and find something even more clever. I might just slog on my next reading; this time through, I mostly ignored the foreign language bits (and felt smart when I could figure them out without looking them up). They do tell you something about the characters, though - about their education, their experience, their intelligence.<br /><br />4) You don\\'t like woven story lines, where details from the early pages come back and surprise you later. If you don\\'t like to pay close attention, DON\\'T READ THIS. There are no superfluous facts here; everything is relevant. While that makes for slow reading (for me), it\\'s rich and satisfying.<br /><br />5) You like your fiction strictly black-and-white. If you want your good guys good and your bad guys bad, and only happy outcomes for likable, innocent characters, DON\\'T READ THIS. This one is all about shades of gray. Characters are deep. Some do good things for selfish motives and bad things for noble causes. Bad guys win battles, innocents are hurt, unlikable people have happy endings, traitors get the best of two worlds. Nothing here is predictable.<br /><br />In summary: engaging, but challenging. Funny, but sometimes with a just-beyond-my-grasp intelligence. I know some of my Goodreads friends would thrive in that environment. You know who you are. To you, I say READ THIS!<br /><br />As to whether I\\'ll read more in Dunnett\\'s Lymond Chronicles, I think I will. But I need a break first.<br /><br />10/15/2015: Rereading this one and LOVING it!',\n",

       "   'text': '3.5 stars, and, yes, I wish that I could justify more.<br /><br />I wanted to love this book. With the rest of the series already sitting on my shelf in the assumption that I would love it, imagine my surprise when I had to force myself to keep reading after the first 50 pages. If it hadn\\'t come so highly recommended or if people hadn\\'t continuously encouraged me to hang on, it would have found it\\'s way to the DNF pile.<br /><br />If you are adventurous enough to begin this book, you will be encouraged with comments from previous readers who tell you it is all worth it. By the end of this book, which required that I also download a companion reference in order to understand it, I have to admit that it was not. Maybe I\\'ll feel differently as I continue with the series, but as a stand alone novel, Game of Kings was disappointing.<br /><br />Maybe it\\'s just me, but I don\\'t think a novel should require a companion reference. <br /><br />I understood the links between the 16th century Stewarts, Tudors, and Douglases and am familiar with the intermingled family trees that resulted in the political escapades of this book. If you don\\'t know that much, well, good luck. <br /><br />What lost me was *every single thing that ever came out of Lymond\\'s mouth*. He speaks in at least four languages, makes references to ancient texts, and rarely makes a statement that is uniquely his own. With the companion at my side, I could at least translate his words, but I often still didn\\'t know why the heck he was saying it. Even after the Big Reveal, I just still didn\\'t like this guy. Not one little bit.<br /><br />Not to say that the novel doesn\\'t have redeeming qualities and better characters. I was rooting for Richard, Lymond\\'s brother, from the beginning and felt no differently about him once he learned The Truth. In fact, he was much more forgiving and compassionate than I would have been. We won\\'t talk about what that means about me. Personally, I felt that there was quite a bit of collateral damage that Lymond never answered for.<br /><br />Other characters had interesting stories and some great one-liners, but it just wasn\\'t enough for me to say that I wholeheartedly enjoyed this novel. I continue to have high hopes for the series but am a little nervous to move on at this point.<br /><br />If you\\'re interested in a more concise, funny, and accessible summary of this book - seriously lots of spoilers - you can <a href=\"http://archiveofourown.org/works/3146252\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">read this</a>, which is shared by <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4674014-marquise\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Marquise</a> in the comments below.

       "   'text': '<i>Whoa.</i><br /><br />This was a bumpy ride, but at its best it was extremely fun, and it was also continually fascinating as an instance of a sort of book I\\'d never encountered before. One I\\'d never even imagined might exist, in fact.<br /><br />So, on the one hand, this is an over-the-top, highly eventful melodrama about a hyper-competent, good-looking, mysterious nobleman with a ~shadowy past~ and a implausibly complicated set of dramatic personal entanglements. The basic concept is one that drives a lot of fanfiction, although in this case it\\'s applied instead to real history: an invented figure who\\'s cooler and more powerful and more interesting than everyone else is inserted into a pre-existing cast of characters (in this case, Scottish and English nobles in the middle of the 16th century), and he proceeds to do a bunch of cool, impressive stuff while the other characters obsess over him. It\\'s a classic (male) <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary_Sue\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Mary Sue</a> story.<br /><br />But then, on the other hand, it\\'s . . . much more well-written and generally well-executed than that premise suggests. The writing is also over-the-top, but in a show-offy hyperverbal way that you wouldn\\'t normally associate with this kind of story. The pages bristle with obscure words, clever and striking turns of phrase, archaisms, and so forth, at times to the point of being as difficult to understand as any arch-modernist. (In particular, the central character -- Francis Crawford of Lymond -- speaks in a verbose rhetorical register, full of obscure classical allusions, that often sounds more like Jabberwocky, or sometimes James Joyce in one of his less intelligible moments, than like ordinary fictional dialogue. He is also fond of reciting [untranslated] French poetry.) The historical detail is apparently well-researched -- not that I\\'d know, but in any case it\\'s lovingly evoked.<br /><br />On top of all that, the plot is as complicated as anything I\\'ve ever seen in fiction: there\\'s an enormous cast of characters, many of whom are referred to by several interchangeable names, everyone is constantly double-crossing each other and making complex, oblique insinuations about each others\\' motives and past behavior, and of course we begin it all in medias res. It feels as populous, intricate and hard to follow as any Russian or Chinese classic.<br /><br />The result is a mixture of low fun and high ambition that\\'s like nothing else I\\'ve ever read. A massive quantity of talent and research applied in a gushing high-pressure blast to the depiction of a sexy superhero who seems to have emerged from some teenager\\'s fantasy life; a plotty, rollicking melodrama that seems to casually assume that its reader is a genius; lustrously haired Fabio with a swooning maiden in one hand and a Ph.D. dissertation in the other. <br /><br />There are (of course!) five equally long sequels. I don\\'t know if I\\'ll finish the series, but I\\'ll definitely keep reading. What a weird, wondrous thing.',\n",

       "   'text': '<i>Some hae meat and canna eat,<br />And some wad eat that wanna,<br />But we hae meat and we can eat,<br />And sae the Lord be thankit. </i> <br /><br />I submitted with as much tranquility as I could muster, to the superfluous Dowagers, the sarcastic sires, the cowed servitors, to see if out of the dark and disastrous muddle, a fragment of pattern would assert itself. I realized over and over again that a thrawness in the vitals of the body politic would either kill this story, or save it. Through it all, I gave a hoot of derisive laughter and felt an unwilling amusement about my mouth. I hoped to open my imagination and to sphacelate in my insufferable vanity, but ended up taking the strain in silence, with an odd mixture of impatience and resignation, bemused by the sickly luxury of the event. <br /><br />My sister Julie got after me a little bit for giving five star ratings to some probably four star books that I just happened to love for whatever reason. She asked a good question: so you’re saying that was as good as “Lonesome Dove?” And I have to admit, that Lonesome Dove is good gold standard for me. Could it really be considered historical fiction? Game of Kings is certainly nothing if not historical fiction. But I have to admit that some of the time, especially through some of the action scenes, it seemed like I was reading with glasses covered with Vaseline. I couldn’t quite grasp or see where she was going and what was happening. Much of the time it seemed awkward and clumsy, overly dramatic, flowery, words that she’d recently studied and read in some of her research thrown into the equation to impress us with her brilliance. The suffering and manliness of the main character, Lymond, seemed to be a woman’s version of what a manly man like Lymond may be like, a sometimes total drunk with fantastic amazing oratory skills but with little real action with the chicks other than playing some pretty songs for them. Many of the relationships Lymond had with women were too subtle to really get any kind of great understanding of what was or wasn’t happening. Much of the plot was designed to make the ending more amazing. <br /><br />So, I made it through the book, I pretty much understood what happened, but it was not a fun experience for me. There’s no doubt that the author’s a genius and amazing in certain ways, but it didn’t really work for me like my gold standard, the amazingly easy to understand and brilliant Lonesome Dove. <br /><br />p.s. I decided to go to three stars. There is a lot to admire about the book. <br />',\n",

       "   'text': \"I'll be honest...this was a very difficult book to read. I think it was the edition, which looks photocopied, which is just horrible for a trade paperback version (for shame, Vintage Books). If publishers are going to be shoddy, then just release it as an ebook, for god's sake.<br /><br />But I just couldn't get into the so-called dashing antihero. Also, the character expositions are explained via dialogue, which means you really have no clue who these people are. Then, the lines of dialogue are not separated, so you don't know when one character stops speaking and another has begun. Again, this could be the shoddy printing, but really badly done.<br /><br />I am a big fan of historical fiction, so I could barely wait to get my hands on this volume, but it simply wasn't worth it. If I want a teleplay with dialogue, I can watch TV. These historical figures did exist and deserve so much better.<br /><br />Book Season = Summer (you might want to leave it in the sand)\",\n",

       "   'text': 'I\\'m no slacker in understanding when it comes to books with much political warfare and maneuvering with fierce battles but this book was hard to follow at times. Trying to keep up with the border lords on either side of the Scotland/England border with all of their double-dealing (some for mere survival due to proximity to said border and other more malicious/mercenary purposes) was confusing at best. Add to that the fact that I am not fluent in French, Spanish and Latin, not conversant in ancient poetry and culture, and my education in obscure mythology ended over 20 years ago with a class in college...and I have to confess this book stretched my brain at times. <br /><br />That being said, I adored it! The characters are magnificently painted...I could rave about many of them, but I\\'ll spare you. I learned to just enjoy the ride knowing I would miss many subtle nuances. There are very few obvious heroes and villains in this book. And, just when you think you\\'ve figured it all out, you turn the page and realize you didn\\'t know anything at all.<br /><br />There is a masterful fencing match between brothers that was written so well I was holding my breath...and after it was over I wished I could\\'ve been there in real time to witness it.<br /><br /><input type=\"checkbox\" class=\"spoiler__control\" aria-label=\"The following text has been marked spoiler. Toggle checkbox to reveal or hide.\" onchange=\"this.labels[0].setAttribute(\\'aria-hidden\\', !this.checked);\" id=\"ab388c9d-5de4-4327-95ba-0ab78249baab\" /><label aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"spoiler\" for=\"ab388c9d-5de4-4327-95ba-0ab78249baab\">I disliked Richard immensely for most of the book, but if he believed the things Lymond was accused of his hatred was justifiable. As the book wore on I came to understand him better. I was always hoping for a reconciliation between the brothers and was happy when that came, although I had almost lost hope. It took Lymond being completely helpless without his wit, charm, health or will to live to soften Richard\\'s heart. I loved the brothers\\' time together, with Richard ministering to Lymond and watching the change of heart. And I love that it sent Richard home hotfoot to reconcile with Mariotta. Richard saved Lymond\\'s life literally, and Lymond saved Richard\\'s life figuratively by fixing his marriage which would allow him to lead a happy life.<br /><br />I did find Lymond\\'s sermon on patriotism odd given that he purports to have done all he did for love of Scotland. His sermon sounded quite disdainful of patriotism and patriots...and he was a patriot. Oh well, I can get over the inconsistency there. He is a very complex character that I thought I understood and when I finished the book I realized I really didn\\'t.</label><br /><br />I look forward to reading the rest in the series. Long live Francis Crawford!',\n",

       "   'text': \"If you, like me, love dangerous, verbally adroit, well read, multi-lingual, penetratingly intelligent heroes, then Francis Crawford of Lymond is your man. Holy nuns in a convent, this is no easy to read bodice-ripping romance, that's for sure. The plot is more complex than Hillary Mantel's <i>Wolf Hall </i> and equally as engaging as a political thriller. Genuine historical figures are woven into the gripping fictionalized account of the Scottish nobleman and Master of Culter, Francis Crawford. Mary of Guise, her daughter Mary, Queen of Scots, Sir William Grey, Lady Margaret Douglas, are but to name a few of the characters who appear in important roles.<br /><br />It took me at least 100 pages to get things sorted out, and I only semi-regret resorting to Wikipedia to determine what the hell was happening in Scotland in 1547. If I'd just held my horses in check, Dorothy Dunnett's novel might have allowed me figure it out myself. Still, even after page 100, I had to concentrate in order to follow the double-dealings and veiled insults. <br /><br />Despite the mental work involved, I was definitely caught up in the excitement and high melodrama involved in saving the Scottish monarchy and the more intense operatic war raging inside the Crawford family's castle walls. Brother against brother. Wife against husband. A mother's machinations to save her sons. Scottish clansmen and Romanies. The television series <i>Outlander</i> is elementary in comparison.\",\n",

       "   'text': '<i>The Game of Kings</i> takes place during The Rough Wooing, a phrase coined by Sir Walter Scott to characterize Henry VIII\\'s 1543-1551 war on Scotland to force Mary (Queen of Scots) to marry his son Edward. In 1547, when <i>Kings</i>takes place, Mary (Queen of Scots), age five, sits on the Scots throne succeeding her father James V (d. 1542). The realm is governed by regents including her mother, Mary of Guise. Edward, age ten, king in-waiting, sits in England, a groom without a bride. Henry is furious. He invades southern Scotland repeatedly, and attempts to fracture the Scots nobility with promises of money, land, and titles. His strategy is working. The border is rife with conflict and the little queen is threatened on her throne. Enter the fictional Lymond Crawford, Master of MidCulter, polymath, \"man of wit and crooked felicities, bred to luxury and heir to a fortune, ...damned by the Church, condemned by the law,\" perceived traitor by both sides. Aided by a motley array of thieves and cutthroats, he manipulates the nobility on both sides like a master of the game for which the book is titled — chess. The question on which the book rests: is he playing for England, Scotland or only himself?<br /><br />Dunnett\\'s intricate chronicle of Lymond\\'s adventures is a marvel. Huge in scope, precise in historical detail, with layers like an onion. No wonder <i>The Washington Post</i> in the 1990s dubbed Dunnett \"the finest living author of historical fiction.\" If you\\'ve any interest in the genre, particularly the 16th century, Dunnett is requisite reading. Penman, Gregory, George, Follet, Cornwell, Seaton, Gabaldan, Rutherford are good, but simply no match for Dunnett\\'s erudite, spare, yet cheeky prose. For example, her brilliant single sentence introduction of Lymond when he invades his ancestral home to confront his mother:<blockquote>\\n  <i>Lucent and delicate, drama entered, mincing like a cat.</i>\\n</blockquote>Perfect. Other characterizations are equally complete and succinct. From the same encounter: <blockquote><br />Lymond\\'s mother: ...<i>\"Sybilla, small and splendid, with cornflower eyes and fair skin...she controlled the household machinery with half her mind and kept her own council about the other half.\"</i><br /><br />The flighty Mariotta: <i>\"Mariotta, black haired and beautiful, walked on air decorated with compliment and envy.\"</i><br /><br />Janet Beaton: <i>\"Janet, big boned and handsome and heartily florid, thirty years younger than Buccleuch (her husband), and the cleverest of a diabolically clever family.</i><br /><br />Sir Walter Scott of Buccleuch (Janet\\'s husband): <i>\"Buccleuch, beaked like a macaw, was a baroque and mighty Scots Lowlander with a tough mind, a voice like St. Columba\\'s....\"</i></blockquote> Dunnett also excels at setting a stage. In two paragraphs, a mere 150 words, she creates a fully realized backdrop for a comedic exchange: <blockquote>\\n  <i>Branxholm, great throne of the Buccleuchs, lay twelve miles from the English border. The present house, less than twenty years old, was built from the crusts of the Branxholms which had already been fired, and fired again, by the enthusiasm of the neighbors. Branxholm was a bald edifice of vile architecture and no blandishments of moss and ivy. Inside, it was the tilting ground and battlefield of the Buccleuch young.<br /><br />Babies bounced and abounded in the Scott household: babies with mouths round and adhesive as lampreys; babies like Pandean pipes, of diminishing size and resonant voice; babies rendering torture and catalysis among the animate, the inanimate and the comatose. The Buccleuchs themselves were totally immune. While their younglings fought, and nurses and tutors swooped and called like starlings, Sit Wat and Dame Janet pursued their own highly individual courses, and talked to each other about whatever came into their heads.<i></i></i>\\n</blockquote>Wonderful. And finally the set pieces. Dunnett\\'s are marvelous, full of life, action suspense, and on occasion even whimsy. From a papingo (parrot) shoot and attempted assassination at a festival: <blockquote>\\n  <i>He (Richard Culter, Lymond\\'s brother) nocked, raising his arm with the poetic, compact motion of a master bowman; the thin echoing official voice called \"Fast\"; he drew, held lovingly, and loosed.<br /><br />His arrow leapt; but another was already airborne. Slender, deadly, red as hot steel in the sun , a shaft came hissing from the farthest suburbs of the crowd. There was never an instant\\'s doubt of its destination. It drove into the crossbar, slicing off the crude ties with a razor barb, freeing the papingo in the instant that Culter\\'s arrow flew toward it.<br /><br />From the audience, a sea of upturned faces, rose a breathy gasp. Weak and stiff from its bonds, the bird jerked grotesquely, fell, wavered, flapped; and with a sudden strong upbeat, recovered itself.<br /><br />As if over its corporate soul the crowd, mesmerized, yearned over the bright wings...as the parrot, gaining height, swooped wildly away from the field, a second arrow breathed by and feathered into its mark. The papingo transfixed in its blundering flight, stopped, tilted and dropped like a stricken star to the ground. A yellow feather, wanton and unseemly, danced its way after.<br /><br />Then, on a wave of roaring uprush, the crowd was moved to action: too late, for a third arrow was already launched.<br /><br />It arched in the air, a gleaming parabola, the feathers susurrant with curses, and found this time its human mark.<br /><br />(Richard) Culter, standing white taunt and watchful at the base of the perch, flung an arm out wildly, held himself a moment upright against the pole, then slowly folded against it and thence to the ground.</i>\\n</blockquote><i>The Game of Kings</i> also contains the best description of a sword duel I\\'ve ever read.<blockquote>\\n  <i>In all the length of the bare room, no one spoke. The long blades exploded together, cracked, chimed, and clattered; the stockinged feet slid and shuffled, and the two men breathed in gasps, quickly, traversing and gyrating, slipping in and out of sword-length, each in a cocoon of whirling light. A blizzard of suns on walls and ceiling enclosed them.</i>\\n</blockquote><i>The Game of Kings</i> is a challenge to read, mixing fact and fiction, it is told in dense, rich language with historically accurate scraps of speeches, songs, sonnets, in Gaelic, French and Latin. It is dense, by design, harkening to the language of the time, while also presenting a thoroughly modern thriller. No word is surplus. All provide clues to Lymond\\'s history, purpose, and character as in this excerpt of Lymond being taken apart by his mother Sybilla on their first meeting in five years:<blockquote>\\n  <i>\"Your drama wants dialogue\"<br /><br />He turned on her the vague survey. \"Oak of line and pole of jewels, I\\'ve decide on pantomime.\"<br /><br />\"What a shame now. I was all ready for buskins, and it\\'s nothing but socks.\"<br /><br />An approaching voice, of the self same timbre, answered him. \"Farce, then,\" said the Dowager composedly. \"My son is not very complicated, Mariotta, although the artifice glitters. He\\'s afraid -\"<br /><br />\"Afraid!\" Blue eyes, dead of feeling, looked into blue. \"Afraid of what?\" Damned by the Church and condemned by the law: what possible capacity for fear can heart and head still find? Oimè el for, oimè la testa...After five years of villainy, I promise you I have the refinement of a cow-cabbage.\"<br /><br />\"Afraid I might puncture the cocoon of Attic detachment. What we see is acting, isn\\'t it Francis.\"</i>\\n</blockquote> Reading the above you may be tempted to shy away. Trust me. Give it at least a 100 pages. Let the richness of Dunnett\\'s prose carry you into Lymond\\'s world. Between 50 and 100 pages, the flow of the story will grab you, and you\\'ll be eager to continue. You will be turning pages as fast as you can!<br /><br />Bottomline: <i>The Game of Kings</i> is exquisite. Five very bright stars. On my buy, borrow, skip scale: a very definite buy.<br /><br />For maximum enjoyment, read with buddies and discuss as you go. Friends Jennifer, Nataliya, Nastya and I engaged in rich discussion/debate as we worked our way through. Thanks ladies!

       "   'text': 'I died reading this. And I loved every second of it. <br /><i>Have not edited this review for grammatical errors yet. </i><br /><br />I do not think I will be able to deliver the prolific and detailed review that this literary masterpiece of a book deserves. One of the main reasons is that I have not been able to get the time to write long reviews (I woke up early this morning just to be able to write this review), and second, when it comes to this book, I feel like my thoughts are so scattered and all over the place. <br /><br />I would like to start by explaining a little about what this book is about, but I am terrible at it, especially for this particular book. I have been gushing over this book around my friends for months (ever since I started reading it) and obviously, the next thing I am asked is, what is it about? <br /><br /><b>Set in 1547, revolving around the return of an ingenious, conniving, and infamously devious Scottish outlaw with his band of miscreants, back in the country, years after fleeing from the country after being discovered to be allegedly working with the English behind Scotland\\'s back. </b><br />And he has a very important mission; he is looking for 3 Englishmen whom he believes can fix his tarnished reputation. While Lymond might be the \"King\" of the board, there are many other important and more dangerous pieces that are striving to strike him down. The rest of the book is basically how the rest of the game plays out. <br /><br />I believe I have nothing new to add that the others haven\\'t already talked about. Lymond is one of the best protagonists that you would come around. He in no way is \"nice\". It feels so silly using such a simple and bland adjective next to his name. He is an incredibly complex character, extremely charming, attractive, poetic, knowledgeable, sharp-tongued, and almost always ahead of everyone else. He is just that incredibly stunning. For the most part of the book, we only see these incredible qualities in him that make him seem almost non-human. Because that is how he has trained himself to act after all these years of whatever it is he had gone through away from his family. We do not know much about it, but Dorothy Dunnett gives us glimpses of his old and harsh life once in a while. <br /><br />And I do have to also talk about just how much of a brilliant writer Dorothy Dunnett is. And how equally difficult. I was not lying when I said I died reading this book. The language is difficult. On top of that, there are some 10,000 historical and mythological references, and our lovely protagonist doesn\\'t;t know how to speak in prose and cannot stick to English for long, so he will be throwing in French, Gaelic, German, Spanish and what not and if the readers care enough to know what he\\'s going on about, they would have to do their own research. So no, it is not an easy book to read. Requires time, and patience but isn\\'t it all worth it? Because the plot is so exhilarating, it keeps you hooked so badly that you want to put in that kind of effort just to know more about Lymond. Just to see bits of him that you don\\'t get to see. I feel the last 40% of the book was just that. It was intoxicating, heartbreaking too, but so intoxicating. It was extremely difficult to put down the book. And it made you fall in love with Lymond all the more. <br /><br /><br />There were parts where I actually cried because it was absolutely heartbreaking. <input type=\"checkbox\" class=\"spoiler__control\" aria-label=\"The following text has been marked spoiler. Toggle checkbox to reveal or hide.\" onchange=\"this.labels[0].setAttribute(\\'aria-hidden\\', !this.checked);\" id=\"ad0ce3a1-4b25-435c-aeed-8fbd0053159f\" /><label aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"spoiler\" for=\"ad0ce3a1-4b25-435c-aeed-8fbd0053159f\"> Christian\\'s death crushed me. The scene with Lymond. And then Erskine finding out. </label> <br /><br />There were characters I despised, I loved (Tom, Buccleuch, Sybilla, Christian, even Will), I hated at first but was okay at the end, although I still am not sure how I feel about them (Richard, I\\'m looking at you)<br /><br />I have already started the second book, but it\\'s a bigger struggle because there is barely any referenced material available for it. But it is what it is, and I feel after the first book, I have gotten the hang of the writing. Hopefully, I will be able to finish it before this month.',\n",

       "   'text': 'I am emotionally compromised by this stupid, exquisite book and this stupid, exquisite, complicated protagonist. I love a book that doesn\\'t shy away from being relentlessly clever and never dumbs anything down for easier comprehension. While this definitely created an initial adaptation period for me - it\\'s not a story you can read particularly casually, you have to pay attention and keep up, and you can\\'t take anyone or anything at face value (ok, with the possible exception of Will Scott, lol) - it\\'s also what makes this story stand out. It\\'s the perfect setting for its main character\\'s own brilliance and constant intricate intellectual performance. <br /><br />There is a never-ending slew of classical and scholarly references, and I have to admit I didn\\'t chase up every one of these because it would really have disrupted my reading flow. Lymond never stops talking, which means he never stops quoting, or singing, or polyglotting, and if I\\'d looked up every quote, I\\'d have taken a year to read this. Mostly I just assumed they were terribly clever and moved on, and occasionally I got one and felt super-accomplished, lol. That probably sounds annoying or intimidating but it\\'s really not. So many of the historical novels being written today just have the characters talking like modern people, with a few token archaicisms for spice. This wasn’t like that – there were no fake thees and thous here, but these people talked like people with a 16th century equivalent to the modern pop culture references we strew our conversation with. They have songs and books and philosophies and artists that are a current part of their cultural and educational experiences, and that’s reflected in their language. It contributed to the immensely authentic feel and flavour of this world.<br /><br />The politics and various schemes and counter-schemes were beautifully plotted, and the chess theme of the structure really worked. I can see why so many fantasy authors later nicked that theme, but honestly, no one I’ve read has yet actually pulled it off with such aplomb. <br /><br />The characters and their many tangled schemes and twists of loyalty were so well crafted. Again, everyone’s clever (well, almost everyone) but no one’s perfect; Lymond’s family and their interweaving stories of betrayals past and present, real or tragically inferred, as well as their endlessly layered strata of complicated emotions for each other (Richard, you damn fool), kept me grinding my teeth and making me want to smack them a lot for being too damn prideful to ever just freaking talk to each other straight up, but boy did it make for excellent entertainment. Christian Stewart broke my fucking heart. Will was… lol, Will. I wanted to pat him a lot and then, yes, also to hit him a lot. <input type=\"checkbox\" class=\"spoiler__control\" aria-label=\"The following text has been marked spoiler. Toggle checkbox to reveal or hide.\" onchange=\"this.labels[0].setAttribute(\\'aria-hidden\\', !this.checked);\" id=\"4c06386f-4b68-4b6b-adc5-7b0fa8242893\" /><label aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"spoiler\" for=\"4c06386f-4b68-4b6b-adc5-7b0fa8242893\">(And I was endlessly amused when part of the defence at the trial was that he was an upstanding young man of excellent moral character who felt nothing \"unhealthy\" for Lymond, when there was that brothel scene where he thought he knew what would happen if he went upstairs, AND HE WENT QUITE DETERMINEDLY INDEED.) </label> Every single one of the women was awesome – I mean, Sybilla rules everything, obviously, but I also have a soft spot for Mariotta and her pride, and I adored Kate with her ruthless practicality.<br /><br />And then there’s Lymond – again, a character frequently copied (more below) and rarely achieved again. I don’t think I have words? He’s used up all the words. All I can say is I was right there with Will, captivated and fascinated and furious and exasperated at this mercurial figure who effortlessly dominated every scene, who’d gone through so much and done so much but couldn’t actually be much older than Will himself; that I laughed my head off when he vivisected people with his tongue or ran circles around their slower brains; that I tried to keep up with his schemes and usually was at least three steps behind, like everyone else; that I bit my fingers bloody when Richard finally caught up with him and every one of their past grievances exploded in exactly the most devastating ways imaginable; that I was holding my breath through every moment of the trial. I want more and I’m so happy there is more but I also think I might need a wee break before the next book because boy am I a wreck :D<br /><br /><br /><br />A quick note on the related subject of C.S. Pacat’s Captive Prince trilogy and The Lymond Chronicles’ influence thereon: After reading both of her cited sources of influence, Mary Renault’s Alexander trilogy and the first of the Lymond series, I have to admit that I’m conflicted. Captive Prince does have a lot of original content, unique relationships and characters, and genuinely lovely writing. However, to me, the palpable influence of both Renault and especially Dunnett goes well beyond inspiration and, sadly, into the murky realms of semi-copycatting that I’m not entirely pleased or comfortable with. I love Laurent and would fight for him barehanded. But after reading this book, I cannot see my way to considering him as a character apart from and independent of Lymond, his all too apparent template. Not when every part of his appearance, his mind, his way of thinking, his responses, is lifted so wholesale from Lymond, down to individual descriptors – and while obviously no author holds a copyright on individual words, consider the words themselves: <i>Acidulous. Damascened. Insouciant. Roseate. Seraphic. Aureate. Calyx. Limpid.</i> These are not commonplace words that might easily apply to one razor-tongued, endlessly scheming, complex, unfairly attractive, fair-haired, cornflower-eyed compelling manipulator, as well as to his completely identical brother from another literary mother. They’re unusual, elevated words, uniquely chosen to describe exquisiteness, and when a different author uses those same words to describe a practically identical character, well, I’m gonna lift an eyebrow because then in my opinion we have moved beyond inspiration and into just plain crafty thieving. This is to a degree okay – writers are thieves, I’ve thieved enough myself – but it’s pretty blatant. And it’s not limited to individual words, or the overall similarities of Lymond and Laurent. There are several key scenes in this book (a sword fight and a trial especially come to mind) that were very very familiar from CP, and I recall a few others from the Alexander trilogy. To me, that’s more than inspiration. Maybe I’m just extra-pedantic about it. C. S. Pacat has made no secret of her sources of inspiration, and that certainly protects her from Cassandra Claire-ian levels of unsavoury appropriation; and I do love Captive Prince and its characters enough that I think I’ll still be able to revisit and enjoy them wholeheartedly. But I’m afraid I’ll always be aware that they’re not nearly as original as they might appear at first glance.',\n",

       "   'text': 'This is one of my favorite books of all time, and I\\'m shocked that I apparently haven\\'t reviewed it here. I also worry that as I\\'ve loved it more every time I\\'ve read it, I am now dangerously past the point of being able to be remotely objective about it. I will make an attempt, while warning that nobody makes me feel as inadequate about my own writing skills as Dunnett, and whatever I write is a poor substitute for you just reading it. In no particular order, the strengths of this book are : <br /><br />1) It\\'s complicated. I tried and flamed out on reading this book twice I think before I managed to get through it on the third try. Normally this is the fault of the author; in this case I will take the blame. I did not invest enough effort into it, and I didn\\'t understand what was going on, so I quit. I was expecting the usual brand of \"lazy\" books where you don\\'t have to pay too much attention. Dunnett says a lot of things flat out, but she also hides a lot of nuggets of information in passing, and if you\\'re not paying attention you\\'ll miss them. Some people may find that a turnoff; for me, it\\'s why I keep reading it repeatedly. Almost every time, I\\'ll find something I missed earlier. <br /><br />2) Characters. They\\'re all great, they\\'re all multifaceted and with their own drives and ambitions and personalities, even minor ones have their quirks. Even Lymond, the Renaissance Man Par Excellence, I think is maybe not as great as he appears to be. That definitely becomes even more true in later books, but even in this one I get a sense of projection to cover his own failings. He himself even alludes to it in one of my favorite quotes in the book, where someone\\'s accused him of concocting some complicatedly nefarious plot, and his response is : <br /><br />\"All I ask in this world is half an hour when I don\\'t know what I\\'m doing; but no one has granted me the privilege yet.\"<br /><br />3) Female characters (yes, it\\'s worth its own point). None of these are an appendage to serve as a man\\'s motivation. Nobody gets fridged, nobody\\'s a trophy to be chased and won by a man (with the possible exception of Agnes Herries, but if she\\'s a trophy that\\'s largely literal since she\\'s a wealthy heiress who brings a lot of money/land/retainers with her). Christian Stewart is a kind, warmheartedly loyal friend with a fast wit and an ear (forgive the pun) for language that can even match against Lymond himself. She\\'s also blind, but that\\'s never treated like a handicap or a thing thrown in just to make her different. Mariotta is frustrated and lonely because her barely-known newlywed husband won\\'t make any time to include her in his affairs, and makes mistakes based on that. Margaret Lennox, though a smaller player in this book, is a proud, ruthless schemer and a dangerous enemy to cross. Mama Sybilla might be one of my favorites in the book -- she\\'s understated and in the background a lot of times, but she\\'s *very* sharp and rarely misses a trick, and works tirelessly to keep her family together, and saves one of her sons\\' lives at a critical late moment in the plot. <br /><br />4) The plotting is very tight. It\\'s a slow build to a grand finale but everything has a careful purpose in mind and we don\\'t make random dead-end detours (hello, Brienne wandering about the Stormlands for most of A Feast For Crows accomplishing exactly nothing). <br /><br />5) It\\'s all historical! Dunnett decided when writing she was going to cover a ten-year span, and what a ten-year span to pick. I didn\\'t know that Queen Mary/Elizabeth, Ivan the Terrible, and Suleiman the Magnificent were all contemporaries, and Lymond interacts with them all over the course of the series. They\\'re action-packed years, and with the exception of Lymond\\'s immediate family and close acquaintances, a large number of the people he interacts with are actual historical personages, and it\\'s awesome how she interleaves the fiction and the factual. <br /><br />6) The whole series is finished. I say this because I was personally recommended onto this series by someone with whom I was having a shared gripe session about the continuing unfinished state of Game of Thrones, so this may be a relevant point for others considering getting into this. This is not Wheel of Time (I recognize that that has since been finished by Brandon Sanderson), this is not Kingkiller Chronicles, this is not Gentleman Bastards, this is not [fill in the blank with your series of choice whose author has stalled out]. <br /><br />7) As a review on the whole series : the whole thing ties together. Parts of some books acquire new significance with others, and there\\'s a grand arc of character growth through the whole thing (again, even for minor characters). And yet each book has a different tone and style. I may be criminally abridging, but I\\'ve always felt : <br />* Game of Kings is an adventure story<br />* Queens\\' Play is a whodunit<br />* Disorderly Knights is a war story<br />* Pawn in Frankincense is a Go On A Quest story<br />* Ringed Castle is an introspective character study<br />* Checkmate is a romance<br /><br />I rarely make blanket statements but : everyone should read this book.<br /><br />~~~<br /><br />ETA 4/28/23 : I am docking a star for some uncalled-for racism present in the text. My original review stands, but with some distance I can recognize that there are flaws in this book (and this author) as well. When, at a late stage in the book, Dunnett opines that \"Romanies, having no use for confessions and excuses, prefer to reach a crooked point quickly.\" -- I find it impossible to justify. Johnnie Bullo, as a character, may prefer to reach a crooked point quickly. I think it\\'s part of his charm, really. But there is a distinct and chasm-wide difference between saying \"Mr Goldstein was an unscrupulous man with a nose for money\" and \"Jews are an unscrupulous people with a nose for money\". We are alive to and on guard against anti-Semitism nowadays, perhaps because of the unforgettable hell of the Holocaust. Anti-Romani stereotypes are sometimes harder to spot, but I think it is worth calling out -- the lack of visibility is precisely what makes it easier for minority groups like the Romani to be othered and mistreated. Lest we forget : Romani died in the Holocaust as well, and in a horrifically high proportion of their prewar population. ',\n",

       "   'text': 'I had some trepidation going into this book. I love the <i>idea</i> of big sprawling historical novels full of adventure and drama and a colourful depiction of some past time. We live in a great time for this kind of historical novel--but I find that most don\\'t sit well with my moral sensibilities. <br /><br /><i>The Game of Kings</i> does--just.<br /><br />This book is an odd blend of high and lowbrow. On the highbrow end of the scale, we have obviously a wonderful grasp of the history, weaving real and invented events together with great skill; multiple references to Renaissance literature, poetry, and song; frequent flights into Latin, French, and other languages; and the writing style itself, which swings wildly between hey-that\\'s-actually-a-neat-turn-of-phrase and honestly-I-haven\\'t-the-slightest-clue. This is written by someone who loves juggling with words as much as her scapegrace hero does, and the result is that about half the time I was baffled as to what on <i>earth</i> the characters were actually trying to say. Let me just say how unaccustomed I am to being confronted with so <i>many</i> words I\\'d never seen before in my life. This is not always a good thing, of course. The tormented verbiage cluttered up what should have been a fairly straightforward and clever plot. The dictionary on my ereader had never seen some of the words before in <i>its</i> life either. Otherwise, I <i>think</i> I know what a cataphract is...and it means nothing like what the author tried to use it to mean.<br /><br />On the lowbrow end of the scale, I have some good things and bad things to say. First of all, the book is obviously written to appeal to twentieth-century audiences, after all. As usual in lowbrow historical fiction, there\\'s a lack of religious sentiment and observance which actual renaissance people would have found quite surprising. Meanwhile, every so often something would drag me out of the renaissance milieu: a reference to \"a clinical study\", or to Brahma of Hindu mythology, things that somewhat stretch the boundaries of what even a Renaissance dweller would be familiar with.<br /><br />Given this, I might add how <i>delighted</i> I was by the depiction of the women in this story. Dunnett does not swallow the usual line about women in the past being incapable of using their brains and influence, or unable owing to male oppression. And she knows her history well enough to know that few periods in history saw more brilliant and powerful women than the Renaissance. There\\'s one wonderful scene where a wife is begging her husband to give her the fellowship and companionship she craves, and he contemptuously asks if she wants to lead troops and attend State councils as he does, and it seemed to be building up to a Feminist Moment at which she would say \"Yes, I do!\"--but instead, she responds, no, of course not, she understands and accepts that they have different spheres, but she would welcome the opportunity to have her own hand in public matters by being able to influence him, just as she wants him to influence her in her own domestic sphere of housekeeping and childrearing.<br /><br />O.O<br /><br />I don\\'t believe it! An accurate, sympathetic depiction of historical reality in the relations between the sexes! I don\\'t imagine Dunnett actually sees things this way herself, but that she understands it well enough to so clearly and gracefully enunciate it in the mouth of a period woman was an amazing surprise.<br /><br />There was another lowbrow aspect to this novel that I thoroughly enjoyed. There\\'s some very fine melodrama in this book. I won\\'t say more for fear of spoilers, but Dunnett does a wonderful job of tugging on the heartstrings, setting up a succession of wonderfully compelling situations that kept me turning pages especially toward the end of the book.<br /><br />But for most of the book, I had a hard time remaining interested, and I think that\\'s because of the central character. Lymond is introduced as a kind of cross between Don Juan and Mr Teatime, an axe-crazy lothario who within the first few chapters attempts to <input type=\"checkbox\" class=\"spoiler__control\" aria-label=\"The following text has been marked spoiler. Toggle checkbox to reveal or hide.\" onchange=\"this.labels[0].setAttribute(\\'aria-hidden\\', !this.checked);\" id=\"13695376-4f5b-4567-a08b-0eefd7675b22\" /><label aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"spoiler\" for=\"13695376-4f5b-4567-a08b-0eefd7675b22\">seduce his sister-in-law and then burn down his mother\\'s home</label>. I had a very hard time trying to swallow this, especially in a character I knew was intended to be heroic. Gradually, however, the book reveals new aspects to Lymond\\'s character, eventually clearing his name entirely. There isn\\'t even much more than the hint of lotharing.<br /><br />Which makes this a have-your-cake-and-eat-it-too kind of book. We are presumably supposed to get a frisson of naughty excitement following bad boy Lymond\\'s exploits. But he isn\\'t <i>really</i> as bad a boy as all that; and that seems to me, more or less, the hypocrisy which is the tribute paid by virtue to vice. Dunnett, and perhaps Lymond as well, wants us to believe him worse than he really is, without him <i>actually</i> being a bad man. At least she did not make him an actual villain (like <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1429253430\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">another anti-\"hero\" I read about recently</a>); but he might have made a more convincing villain if she had tried to make him a <i>good</i> boy, as she made his enemy brother, who I found a much more compelling character. Lord Culter (the brother), must repent of his sins; Lymond need only explain them. One of these is theologically correct and dramatically satisfying. The other has only the naughty frisson.',\n",

       "   'text': 'I have never been much interested in the History of Scotland/England. But I hoped this book would change my mind. Sadly it is almost the opposite. <br /><br />This is not a bad book, it is just that it is a bad book for those who do not speak French, German and most probably latin and the Scottish English. Not to mention the fact that they must also be quite familiar with the history of that time period. <br /><br /><b>1.Plot</b> The story is about Lymond, a Scotsman and his involvement in the politics and war between England, scotland and France. Due to the narration I could not comprehend more than that.<br /><br /><b>2. Narration</b> This is the most trying part of the book. I am sure that students of English literature would come to appreciate the writing style of Dunnett. However, a casual reader such as myself would find it quite hard to understand most of the things that are being said, be it in dialogue or otherwise. I have read that this was done to portray an accurate picture of the people who lived at that time. But it also makes it quite a dull affair. Most of the time I had no idea what was being said. (No small amount of that burden falls upon the non English parts of the book) I had a hard time distinguishing between several characters. <br />Accurate portrayal or not, the narration proved too much for a reader such as I.<br /><br /><b>3.Characters</b> From what little I understood, I would have hated Lymond even if the narration was clear and entertaining. He is what I believe they call a \"Renaissance Man.\" He is is a polyglot, knowledgeable in literature, philosophy, mathematics and the sciences, a practitioner of all the martial arts, a spell-binding musician, a talented thespian, and a master strategist with a genius for imaginative tactics. And here I thought Kvothe was too much. <br /><br />Perhaps best suited for Students of literature.',\n",

       "   'text': \"I bought this after seeing the author recommended by Harry Turtledove on Twitter. I'm actually surprised I didn't find this series in my teens. This is historical fiction at its highest: deep, complex, incredibly well researched, and enlightening. The dialogue is so well steeped in the voice of the 1500s that at times I wasn't sure what was happening, but I was so enthralled by the very lyricism that I kept reading nonetheless. <br /><br />The plot itself defies simple description. This is politics at its most topsy-turvy, where prisoners are a commodity to be traded like sacks of wheat, and northern England and the Scottish lowlands see fighting and raids more often than the sun. Amid all this is Lymond: a rogue prone to verse in a myriad of languages, a declared traitor to Scotland who has returned home for presumably nefarious purposes. The reality is far more complicated.<br /><br />The cast is vast, and if you're like me and have trouble tracking names, that can be an issue, especially near the start. The characters are fantastic and realistic, and the sense of place is incredible. I can see why these books are considered classics. I wouldn't mind reading on at some point. I don't usually like rogueish characters, but like many of his peers, I couldn't help but be intrigued by the charismatic Lymond.\",\n",

I start reading one of her ferociously intelligent, intricately plotted books, and I become good for nothing. The laundry goes unwashed. I get no exercise. Yesterday I actually forgot to make my younger son's lunch. I don't care that the language is difficult, that I know nothing about chess. I don't care that Lymond spouts poetry whenever given the chance. I don't care that I probably don't catch four out of five of the literary and historical allusions. All I care about is finding out what happens next. You want escapism? You will escape into 16th C Scotland, but you will get smarter, not dumber, as your mind works its way around the archaic English of the chapter headings and through the twists and turns of the plot, keeping track of the characters and their motivations.

This Character, Lymond! <b>Lyyymmmoonndddd<br />I knew I was going to love this book, but I wasn't prepared for it to be such a heartbreaking and passionate classic.</b><br /><br />At first, this book may seem a little dense or challenging. I tried reading it for the first time a couple of months ago and have to give it up because I knew I wasn't in the right place of mind to enjoyed it as it deserved. I tried again with a Spanish version to ease my way through and by the time I've got %20 done (or by the time Don Luis Fernando made his magnificent performance) I was totally in love with Lymond and his adventures.<br /><br />The book is clever and deep; with great, complex and lovable characters that will make you laugh... But also be prepared to cry!, and to get angry and scream for revenge and cheer for the small victories.... And I could go on for quite some time naming all the feelings this is going to make you experience.<br /><br />You will find here a hero of the caliber of Edmund Dantes, Cyrano, Holmes... or to name a more recent and obvious example, Laurent of Vere :)<br />Lymond has so many layers and shades that will leave you wanting more. I'll definitely keep reading the series and probably re-read this first volume in it's original language to be able to appreciate its sharpness as it was intended.<br /><br />This was a masterpiece of awesome plot twists, more-than-meets-the-eye characters and brilliant humor with a deep and solid storyline. <br /><b>Be prepared to fall in love with a gorgeous blonde that will make you smile any time you are smart enough to get some of his multiple clever remarks or double meanings.

       "   'text': 'I came into this one not knowing what to expect. I only knew the main character inspired one of the heroes of one of my all time favourites stories. If I wouldn\\'t have known that beforehand, I wouldn\\'t been able to pick up the references. Not because they weren\\'t there but because this book is so complex and difficult to follow at first, that almost everything went through my mind without noticing it. <br />I starting reading it in English, but after chapter 3, I had to admit defeat, give up and go for the Spanish translation instead. Despite that, it was still difficult to follow. The writting style isn\\'t one of my favourites, it\\'s like we see all the action and plot turns \"from the outside\" instead of \"living and making\" them, and that made me at first unconnected to the characters. That being said, I think that writting style is precisely what makes the book work. It\\'s accurate for the time and makes possible to add all those references to classics, that were interesting and infuriating equally. I feel that\\'s one of this books that you enjoy more in the reread, because you can eliminate the anxiety about what\\'s going to happen and concentrate in following the leads the author gives behind. <br />One of the things I liked most about the book were its female characters, yes you\\'re reading correctly, I liked female characters in a book. Isn\\'t that awesome? I liked them all, from the more \"superficial\" and anoying, to the more evils. The gamut is huge, and all of them are well fleshed out and complex. <br />And then, we have Lymond. The mastermind, the outlaw, the noble, the seductor. He is so complex and well written. He is a man of his time, a Renaissance man, and it shows all along the pages of the book. The effort the author put into this book to shape the character according to its time is impressive. <br /><br />So, this book is really good, but it\\'s not for everyone. It\\'s difficult to follow and the writting style may be distracting. But if you give it a chance until the very end, I think it pays off. Thanks to my awesome BReaders for the company. We still have a lot to go until we finish to dissect this one. ',\n",

       "   'text': \"I wanted to love this book but it and I just didn't click. It seemed like the perfect book for me when I heard about it. Historical fiction is one of my favorite genres and I love books with a good anti-hero. My very first research paper I wrote for high school I wrote on Mary Queen of Scots and I took a class on the Tudors and Stuarts one semester in college. This book seemed tailor made for me but I just could not get into it.. <br /><br />The historical setting of the book is marvelously written and the characters are interesting for the most part, when you can understand them. I was frustrated by all of the Spanish, French and Latin scattered through the book. It hampered my enjoyment of Lymond's personality because I could not understand half of what he was saying. The plot started off slow and consisted, at first, of nothing but caper after caper showcasing Lymond's brilliance. By the end of the book I was thoroughly annoyed with the man and could have cared less whether or not he was successful in his ultimate goal. He was almost a little too clever, jaded and cynical for my taste.<br /><br />Because I wanted to like these books so much I started reading the second in the series when I finished this one and I had to stop. I just couldn't take it anymore. I will try to come back to them eventually but for now Lymond and I are saying adieu.<br />\",\n",

       "   'text': \"3.5 stars.<br /><br />This novel requires a considerable amount of time and patience, and if you have both of those, then no doubt you will be rewarded with a fantastic reading experience. Dunnett's style is verbose, and can be hard to understand at times - you really need to concentrate, especially as a lot of the time, you need to read between the lines and work out what is actually happening. Dunnett does not dumb things down - she assumes her readers are as intelligent as she appears to be, and in some places, you really have to work hard to keep up. Some of the classical and poetical allusions can be confusing, and if I'm honest, I didn't understand many of them, but it didn't detract too much from my reading experience overall.<br /><br />There's also quite a lot of politics and players within the novel. Thankfully, a list is provided at the beginning of the novel as to who's who, but sometimes it could still be difficult to keep track of everyone. This is not a novel that you can rush through, or just skim read. I'm not familiar with the politics that happened under the reign of Edward VI in England or during the infancy of Mary Queen of Scots, so I feel like I did miss out on a little bit of background knowledge. That could also be the History major in me talking, though. The part of me that likes to know every single little detail about the period that I'm reading.<br /><br />Once you get used to the language though, it's quite easy to become immersed in the novel. It is worth it in the end though, I promise. Scotland in the mid-sixteenth century (Pre-Mary Queen of Scots) is not an area that I know a lot about, so I loved being thrown into the landscape of it all, which Dunnett made so easy to imagine. The leading characters are fabulous - Lymond, Will <s>(can we just talk about how when he thought Lymond was propositioning/seducing him in the brothel/inn he was ready to go for it? Lordy, that boy made me laugh)</s>, Lymond's mother (I feel bad for forgetting her name, I think she's just called the Dowager Lady Crawford?) I absolutely loved, as well as Christian Stewart, who is totally badass (and blind). <br /><br />I've heard that the second novel does get a little bit easier to read. I'm definitely looking forward to picking it up at some point in the future, and can't wait for more swashbuckling adventures. \",\n",

       "   'text': 'I don’t particularly go for historical fiction, but I decided that the only way to get over the pain of <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1756110866\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Captive Prince</a> was to fling myself into the path of more pain and that’s what I gone and did. (and in particular, to the very book that inspired CP)<br /><br />If you’ve never heard of the Lymond Chronicles before, let me give you a short intro: the Chronicles are six sprawling novels, set at around 1550s, starting at the time of the Border Wars between Scotland and England and ending the year Queen Elizabeth takes her throne. There is a large cast with lots of names and lords and castles, but nothing that will discourage the GRRM or Tolkien reader. The main character whose exploits we follow is called Francis Crawford of Lymond and is mostly referred to by his title. This is the first book of the Chronicles, taking place in 1547-49 in Scotland during the Border Wars.<br /><br />This isn’t an easy book to read (firstly because the writing is refreshingly hard, peppered with Latin, French and Spanish phrases, typically left untranslated, and also the way the characters speak, esp. Lymond, is often quite obscure) and it also isn’t easy <b>emotionally</b>. The plot is twisty as nothing else I\\'ve read: there are betrayals and schemes and politics and court intrigue and near misses and revelations and, if you’re as attached as I am to Lymond (and his protégé Will), then you will bite your nails to the quick by the time you get to the end. Tension rises steadily throughout the story and the stakes are high and excruciatingly personal for our hero. Characterisation is superb, every interaction informed by good intentions, misunderstandings, ineptitude, anger, ambition; the characters are human and flawed and deeply fascinating. <br /><br />Let me make another thing clear: you will fall in love with Lymond. I have read some (mostly YA) novels where the narration or other characters talk up the protagonist (\"s/he\\'s so clever, brave, scary, competent\") but we never <i>see</i> it in the actual story. The character talks a big game but their actions aren\\'t anything to write home about. <b>Lymond talks the talk, but also walks the walk. </b>He saves people, attacks people, fights in battles, plots his way through political quagmires, speaks several languages, plays music, can be both tender and cruel, effects miraculous rescues, and he’s <s>always</s> often one step ahead. There are times that he behaves infuriatingly as a double-crossing bastard, and he\\'ll frustrate you no end, until something is revealed and then you\\'ll love him again, or just want to slap him a little for the pain he caused you. <br /><br />tl;dr: <b>Highly recommended for people who like excellent characterisation, superb plotting, a well-researched historical setting, rising tension, and an emotional roller-coaster that\\'ll have you tearing your hair out</b>. Or, as a friend said, \"this is high quality suffering.\"',\n",

       "   'text': \"I first read The Lymond Chronicles in high school over 30 years ago. I had to have a dictionary next to me because every chapter had at least 10 words I needed to look up. Not that I found them in the dictionary. I then went to the encyclopedia and even then I couldn't always find the references. Fortunately a few years back Elspeth Morrison, who loved the books set about to locate all the references and wrote a companion to the series. She did this without the help of Ms. Dunnett as she no longer had her research. With the House of Niccolo Ms. Dunnett kept the research and gave it to Ms. Morrison who then wrote the second companion book. You really need them to appreciate the depth of the books.<br /><br />The Lymond Chronicles start in 1547 in Scottland then move to France, Russia, the Levant and on and on. There will be poetry and phrases in French, Spanish, Portuguese, German, Russian etc.... 5 books of about 500 pages each. There are maps and cast of characters from each book that you will constantly refer to. The companion is a real help with all of this. I fell in love with Lymond from the very beginning. I kept hoping he would turn out to love men, but to no avail.<br /><br />I learned more from her perspective of the Christian vs. Muslim clash than any commentary I have read or heard in today's age. It is also interesting how the 2 series have very different views on this subject due to the time difference and the spread of Islam thru the levant. In Niccolo Islam is taking over the area, in Lymond the Christians are pushing back. <br /><br />My favorite series is Lymond because I fell in love with him as a person. He seems like the perfect man. \",\n",

       "   'text': \"Notes:<br /><br />Happy to have friends to buddy read historical fiction at the Erstwhile Corner (Historical Fiction Jamboree)! I'm sure I would have pushed off reading the book to a murky date if they were not reading the series. =) <br /><br />I believe this is my intro to Dorothy Dunnett. What a lovely writer! I am a fan of her eye for detail, snark, empathy and the way she presented Lymond in all of his glory and shuttered fears. <br /><br />- Excellent example of a character driven story. A prime example of how you can tell a story to the reader via show &amp; tell. <br />- Quick brushstrokes to highlight imagery, but not enough to truly imagine the person/place. <br />- Lots of great dialogue. It may not be realistic, but it's darn fun to hear!<br /><br />- Narration by David Monteath was fantastic! He did a great job of adding light accents without making it impossible to understand what he was saying. I was fine listening to the story at 2.55x, but I slowed it down to 2x because I had fun taking in various scenes and chuckling over the many layers tucked between.\",\n",

I must say Dorothy Dunnett has <s>Dunnett</s> done it. “It” being a seemingly impossible feat of taking a book that I was physically restraining myself from throwing at the wall for the first 70 pages or so and making me love it by the end. <br><br>At the beginning I was reduced to angrily typing this* as I was seething from not understanding any accolades this book received from all my bookish friends:<br><blockquote>\\\\n<i>* “I wish to God,” said Gideon, with mild exasperation, “that you’d talk – just once – in prose like other people.”</i><br><br>Yeah, me too. I wish this book had been written in normal prose, like other authors manage. But apparently both me and Dorothy Dunnett eschew the knowledge that “Brevity is the soul of wit” because why use one word where an ornamental sentence containing a bit of an obscure medieval poetry reference (in French, probably) would do? And so we split into two warring camps here - (1) those who bask in the richness of the language and multilayered complexity of the story and (2) those who view this book as a bramble thicket of overwritten metaphors that grind repartees and battles to eyes-glazing-over stupor.</blockquote><br><b>Yeah, foolish Nataliya from a couple of weeks ago, I laugh at your frustrated naïveté</b>. But in my defense, Dunnett came up with sentences like this: <i>“Dumbness, flowing among them uncovered like a crocus in the snow the lost reprise of a hornpipe, pursuing its scratchy but dogged course in the musicians’ gallery.”</i> Or like this: <i>“The luminous eyes, apparently satisfied with their diet, released their grip.”</i><br><br>So can you blame me for that initial lapse in judgment? Lymond himself would agree, I’m sure.<br>————<br><blockquote> <img src=\\\\\"https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/hostedimages/1641281352i/32402413._SX540_.jpg\\\\\" width=\\\\\"400\\\\\" class=\\\\\"gr-hostedUserImg\\\\\" loading=\\\\\"lazy\\\\\"><br>(Whoever was responsible for those book covers that make this novel look like a cheap bodice-ripper should be hanged. Or quartered. Or both.)</blockquote><br>This book is a historical mystery of sorts, <b>slowly revealing to us the gradual redemption of what initially seems the most irredeemable character</b>. Francis Crawford of Lymond, he of the <i>“cornflower-blue”</i> eyes and a sharp tongue that never stops talking. A traitor and pariah who does not stoop at double-crossing, lying, corruption and even setting fire to his ancestral home while his own mother is inside. Or did it really happen this way? Dunnett will have you find out, slowly, deliberately, while only showing you Lymond through others’s eyes, making you infer his motivations from his actions while he is frustratingly opaque about them, while he plays a masterful chess game of politics too complicated to understand for the longest time, and all while he’s being rude and obnoxious in his obscure quotes-filled excessively erudite speech*.<br><blockquote>* <i>“I am a narwhal looking for my virgin. I have sucked up the sea like Charybdis and failing other entertainment will spew it three times daily, for a fee.”</i><br><br>See what I mean? It’s like he’s trying to drive you insane. And yes, that’s on purpose.</blockquote><br>And yet slowly, slowly the metaphorical layers are peeled off and you realize that not only have you, like pretty much everyone who spends more than five minutes in Lymond’s company, have fallen under the spell of his charisma but that so many things you assumed are wrong. <b>And by the time he starts speaking like less of a prick and more like the Renaissance man he is (seriously, there’s not a subject at which our Francis doesn’t fully excel at) you realize that he actually has quite a few interesting things to say</b> — culminating in that wonderful “patriotism sucks” (paraphrasing here, as you may gather) speech at the end. <br><blockquote>\\\\n<i> “That,” said Henry Lauder, closing his spectacles and throwing his pen in the wastepaper basket, “is a brain. If I were ten years younger and a lassie, I’d woo him myself.”</i><br><br>Don’t we all, Mr. Lauder, don’t we all.

And even the infuriating ones gradually acquire surprising depths (looking at you, Richard of the grey eyeballs!), and get a bit of a redemption for foolish foolhardy choices (Will Scott, something tells me you will need your hand held for a few more years in life), and a gentle lessons in the simple truths of life and marriage (Mariotta, you stupid shallow girl).

And I have a confession to make: I no longer like it.<br /><br />Yes, I\\'m prepared for the public stoning and the flood of \\\\\"unlikes.\\\\\"<br /><br />But I don\\'t want to pretend I am still onboard this long-ago sunk ship and leave my old ratings keep that impression alive. The truth is, I\\'ve reread Lymond several times I didn\\'t even keep track of them all, and with each reread I liked it less and less. And less, and less . . . My GR records only register four rereads, but there were more, the last one was on my own and alone in 2020 during the Covid-19 pandemic and I didn\\'t register it on here. That reread showed me that I had ceased being a fan.<br /><br />I\\'ve had issues with Lymond since my first read, particularly with book 1 and book 6, but they started to grow from my second reread on, when I simply couldn\\'t overlook the mounting problems and decided to never reread the last book again. I kept to that until my last reread, when I reread bits and pieces of \\\\\"Checkmate,\\\\\" and that was probably the killing blow for any remnants of love left for the series. I did discuss it at length with one of my best friends, and I think that should\\'ve been the closure.<br /><br />I don\\'t know if I\\'m the only one, but I don\\'t know anyone else who has become this disenchanted to the point of stopped being a fan of Dorothy Dunnett. It\\'s a bit awkward to be an outlier, and I have tried to discuss my issues before, many times. I thought I would give it another try this April 2023 in a reread with a group of friends<b>*</b>; maybe there\\'d be some positive change this time, I thought, and . . . <br /><br />Part I of \\\\\"A Game of Kings\\\\\" is how long I lasted until I became exhausted and decided it wasn\\'t worth it trying to resurrect the dead. What is gone is gone and won\\'t be back. I\\'ve come to terms with that.<br /><br />So, with that context, here\\'s my updated review stating my reasons (most but not all, or it\\'d be even longer). There be spoilers, beware.<br /><br /><b>THE REVIEW:</b><br /><br />I’ve never liked those books—and TV shows—in which the writers felt that the readers need to have it all spelt out for them for a variety of reasons, mainly the assumption that they will miss it otherwise.<br /><br />And then I found Dorothy Dunnett and met the other extreme of the “dumbing it down for the masses” spectrum. That I didn’t like it either is evident, but my issue isn’t that she employs language that most of humanity won’t get. It’s what it does to the narrative.<br /><br />I won’t include here a summary of the plot, there are excellent reviews out there that have done it better than I could; instead I’ll talk about my own impressions, and so I’ll go point by point.<br /><br />THE PLOT: The story starts interestingly enough, wrenching some laughter from the readers via Lymond’s comical initial antics, and keeping the interest till the middle with a rapid succession of swashbuckling adventures that makes the delight of those of us that grew up crushing hard on d’Artagnan, Edmond Dantès, and Percy Blakeney. <br /><br />You begin to see in Francis Crawford of Lymond another potential classic hero to love. You start to make conjectures about the genesis of his mystifying feud with his elder brother, you mull earnestly over your own hypotheses that would explain things ranging from why he doesn’t kill his brother to why he seems to be courting his sister-in-law, you try to make sense of his mother’s baffling sang froid towards two sons that aim to rip each other’s throat, you laugh at Lymond’s abduction of a certain lady and the way he outmanoeuvres his pursuers, you admire his pluck, his ruthlessness, his apparent flexible morality, his devil-may-care attitude in playing chess with humans that results in the death of an innocent woman . . . By the time of the duel, you think you know—as much as you can surmise from the obscure narrative—who and what he is and what he may be doing or may have done.<br /><br />But then the last pages come. The courtroom comes. And it all goes down in a crash.<br /><br />The author that hadn’t given a fig for whether her readers would or wouldn’t grasp what she was saying and what the storyline was about, resorts to a literary technique that smells suspiciously of Agatha Christie, in my opinion. We find out that, oh no, it wasn’t precious Lymond after all, it was that weakling Dandy. That’s so, folks, the assassin was the butler all along, and with a stroke of the plume everything that had added some layers of greyness, of human fallibility and base demeanour is swept away from Lymond’s sheet, which is left lily-white clean. And what’s worse, it’s not even Lymond who unveils it; it’s his mother. There’s a word for that trope: character idealisation, or in plain slang, Mary Sue-ness. <br /><br />The courtroom wasn’t an appropriate closure, it was anticlimactic. With it, the reader’s laborious mental work during the entirety of the book just doesn’t pay off. You were lost and buried under the avalanche of rhymes and preciousness, and didn’t understand what the thing was about? Don’t worry, it will be explained, no, spelt out in detail, to you at the end during Lymond’s trial. Without his distracting rhyming (for the most part) and obtuse referencing, so you won’t miss a thing. Isn’t it just wonderful; all that worry that you were missing something was for naught, all that theorising and guessing was for naught, the author is telling you what happened, so the job is done for you. <br /><br />This I can’t forgive Dame Dorothy for. One star is lost.<br /><br />THE CHARACTERISATION OF THE HERO: Although I tend to prefer deeply flawed men with scores of layers, men who aren’t redeemed with a stroke of a magical plume and that know what they are, unapologetically so, yet still are likable because one dozen or two of their layers are relatable, very human, I can also love the more conventionally perfect brand of literary heroes. With a caveat: that they must be believable. There is where the characterisation of Lymond fails. He isn’t believable; not only is he extremely capable at everything under the sun, which itself alone would be enough to cast a fake varnish over his character, but he’s also so young for all these achievements and besides he\\'s physically impressive. Sure, there were—and are—some extraordinary souls that can leave us mere mortals with our jaws hanging low in amazement. But they also have their darker sides. Which is Francis’? Hard to tell from the way Dunnett has described him. He feels more like an idealised Renaissance man raised exponentially to the Nth degree: a Leonardo da Vinci with the handsomeness of Leonardo DiCaprio and the luck of Lucifer and an early fame to match Alexander the Great. <br /><br />His idiosyncratic speech doesn’t help much either, but would’ve been better taken in if not for Dunnett’s decision to spread the same merry rhymin’ and recitin’ across several pages and characters, which brings me to the next point.<br /><br />THE LANGUAGE: For many readers, language is the sole reason they can’t persevere with this book, and a good reason this is. A very good one.<br /><br />As a polyglot myself, I didn’t have excessive trouble with the quotes in French and Spanish, and could comprehend the Latin quotations as well, and the German and Italian, without needing the Dunnett companion. I was able to recognise the source of many of them from earlier readings of Spanish writers from the period and some Roman classics; they aren’t that unknown to a well-read person as the Olde English ones. The Middle-English quotes gave me more headaches because they were just too obscure. I don’t know if, were they from more known period sources like, say, Shakespeare, a greater number of readers would’ve gotten them, because he’s more accessible. But that’s not the case, the quotes she includes, without name of the source, aren’t readily recognisable, which may be due to the fact that they’re chess quotes, though not all of them are. <br /><br />Because of that, and the fact that the quotes can be skipped with no loss, I said that my issue isn’t the language itself as much as what it does to the narrative. I’m not sure I can explain this in a way that conveys exactly what I mean, but I’ll try. <br /><br />First things first, let’s state the bare facts: the quotations aren’t restricted to chapter openings. They are all over the place, everywhere. Second: Lymond can’t speak without a quote thrown in to save his life. Third: And it’s not only Lymond, other characters are afflicted with the Quotation Fever as well. Now my point: it’s excessive. If the literary references were for chapter openings or for reinforcing the chess-imagery only, then very good. If not that, then if the quotations were made to be a speech quirk of Lymond’s only, it’d be counted as a character trait, irritating or endearing depending on the reader’s taste but no more than that. But he’s not the only one that speaks like that, others do too, and that gives the impression of being in the company of actors, not of real people that existed at the time. The little foreign-language lines are too distracting even if you don’t read them, because they interrupt the flow of the dialogue and force you to either stop to try to understand it, or to skip them, so you read dialogue hop-hopping from one English phrase to the next. And though likely the Guides that were written to clarify these will disagree with me on this, I can say that a good number of them are just too random and don’t really add to the narrative. At times, it even reads like Dunnett was just showing off; there are lines that could support my point. <br /><br />It’s that sense of unreality brought in by that narrative style what I liked the least. The period description and the historical accuracy may be splendid, though I disagree here (they aren\\'t), but the characterisation, the language and Dunnett’s storytelling left me with the sensation of watching a mummer’s show instead of real people in real events, which I appreciate in historical fiction. I felt like the characters were actors performing for an audience, they spoke like actors for an audience, and the events unfold just like in a scripted play in which the characters are the puppets moved by a master puppeteer, not events that unfold naturally and suffer the setbacks of chance and human nature. Mummery, in sum, it felt like mummery. Artificial, implausible, not believable. <br /><br />So, to conclude, the book loses two more stars on account of the last points, and is left with two only. Now, let\\'s move to the much-lauded accuracy and research by Dunnett.<br /><br />THE ACCURACY: Fans of this series like to slavishly praise it for its supposed impeccable historical research, and yet, in the very first opening scene there\\'s already a historical error. And there\\'s another in the first chapter, so you can imagine how many more there are if there\\'s this many so early in the book; those who know the history of the 16th century will be able to spot at least three early enough, and that\\'s not a good sign.<br /><br />Added to this accuracy point is the historicity/historical plausibility part. Dunnett falls in the same trap as many other writers: she has her fictional character meet and be close to all the important real characters. It\\'s not as heavy-handed in this first book, but throughout the series Lymond becomes a Forrest Gump of the 1500s, going from here to there to meet all the Big Names of the period like he has a bucket list, going as far as Russia. Do you find all this credible? His connections to the Scottish court and relationship with the child Queen already stretch credulity, but what happens in the next books break all sense of plausibility. Who in the historical record for the 16th century is there that\\'s remotely as well-connected and well-travelled and well-accepted everywhere regardless of religion and race as Lymond is? Nobody. Some might not mind it and love the grand adventure aspect, but I do demand plausibility in my Hist-Fic. Mindset wise, Lymond doesn\\'t belong in his period either. He\\'s very modern-minded, a product of the 1960s than of the 1560s, not a man of his times.<br /><br />THE TREATMENT OF FEMALE CHARACTERS: In AGOK, there\\'s one woman who is Lymond\\'s match in every sense: Christian Stewart, the blind lady of Boghall. She was well-educated, very smart, well-connected, independent and enterprising in spite of her blindness, and the only one who could talk with Lymond in his convoluted language. And she was sacrificed for male angst.<br /><br />Yes, Christian Stewart\\'s fate was merely for Lymond to angst over. It\\'s the equivalent of using female rape so the hero can angst and wangst over it for all eternity in the book, as it later happens in another book in the series. I have seen arguments that if she had lived she\\'d have been a \\\\\"burden\\\\\" for Lymond. Ableist hogwash! She was capable on her own, and her disability would\\'ve actually been a good way to realistically portray the challenges someone like her would have to face, which would\\'ve made for more challenging but interesting plots than grooming Pippa to be another sacrifice.<br /><br />All the women in this series are sacrifices on the altar of Lymond, misogynistically used to create, nurture, and grow his angst and suicidality. Even Kate, who supposedly escapes this fate, in reality doesn\\'t. She\\'s also sacrificed and given a consolation prize in the end in the form of a man that she didn\\'t really need. She could\\'ve kept her Gideon, but that would\\'ve meant less angst for Saint Francis the Perfect.<br /><br />And this is merely in the first book, because every single book in this series right until the epilogue of \\\\\"Checkmate\\\\\" has a woman sacrificed for Lymond. The first book has two, the second book has one, the third book has one, the fourth book has one, the fifth book has one, the last book has two. This is a very troubling pattern in Dunnett\\'s writing that few seem to be bothered by. I am bothered by this, and always have been. The sacrifice of Christian was the benchmark for me even before that awful plot point in \\\\\"Checkmate,\\\\\" and the more I\\'ve reread this, the more troubling I find it. How is it possible that a series where women live for the hero be praised for being so good with female characters? Don\\'t readers see the issue?<br /><br />THE LANGUAGE II: Another aspect Dunnett is undeservedly praised for is the use of foreign languages. For a character who supposedly speaks so many languages and is a linguistic wunderkind, Dunnett\\'s use of foreign language for Lymond isn\\'t that good. In fact, in this first book, it\\'s shitty.<br /><br />Take the Don Luis scene, which is offensively racist and relies entirely on stereotypes. I can tell Dunnett never met a Spaniard in her life if she thinks Will\\'s name would be pronounced \\\\\"Huile\\\\\" by a Spanish speaker. On top of that, she used Spanish incorrectly, there\\'s wrong words wrongly \\\\\"translated,\\\\\" and the articles are incorrect as well; even when a line is correct, that\\'s not the Spanish that would be spoken in the 1500s (see Don Quixote in the original for a quick check). Where\\'s the vaunted accuracy and linguistic gift? Nowhere.<br /><br />And that\\'s only one scene with one foreign ethnicity, don\\'t get me started on the depiction of the \\\\\"Gypsies\\\\\" in this book that is racist as well. And no, you can\\'t say it\\'s the characters that are, because the POV is universal narrator, ergo an authorial choice. In other books, there\\'s also racial stereotyping and exoticisation that is authorial choice and not characters\\' views.<br /><br />I could go on with examples, but I think the above suffice to make my point. I\\'ve reread this series enough times to know there\\'s no turning back for me. Some series survive several rereads, but <i>The Lymond Chronicles</i> was the opposite for me, and that is it.

Lymond is a young man, exiled from Scotland for treason, who has now snuck back into the country and is busy making waves and causing trouble, for reasons that gradually are revealed. <br><br>Dorothy Dunnett uses chess terms as chapter titles and Middle English quotes about chess at the start of most chapters, and really this book is very much like one massive chess game, played by a master player.<br><br>Parts of <i>Game of Kings</i> were completely fascinating: I always enjoy reading about a person who has their own mysterious agenda, which they follow to the end while everyone around them sees only their small piece of the puzzle. This book is very well-written, and a lot of the scenes really came to life for me. The last couple of hundred pages kept me up until past 1:30 am reading, since I couldn\\'t put the book down unfinished.<br><br>But (and this is a fairly large \\\\\"but\\\\\") any book that reminds me of reading <a href=\\\\\"https://goodreads.com/book/show/338798.Ulysses\\\\\" title=\\\\\"Ulysses by James Joyce\\\\\" rel=\\\\\"noopener\\\\\">Ulysses</a> in college, I\\'m going to have some issues with. Lymond is a brilliant scholar as well as an athlete ― and musician, and excellent swordsman and archer, and . . . well, I\\'m not sure there\\'s anything he doesn\\'t do well. Except not be an asshole. So aside from being a bit of a Gary Stu, which I have absolutely no issues with when the book is good enough, Lymond is given to dialogue that includes various quotes in French or Latin (which Dunnett <i>never</i> bothers translating for you) and obscure literary references that may have been familiar to well-read people back in the 16th century but certainly aren\\'t well-known now. I was an English major in college, and most of this stuff I did not get AT ALL. <br><img src=\\\\\"https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/hostedimages/1404402760i/10233747.gif\\\\\" width=\\\\\"250\\\\\" height=\\\\\"280\\\\\" alt=\\\\\"description\\\\\" class=\\\\\"gr-hostedUserImg\\\\\" loading=\\\\\"lazy\\\\\"> <br>Here\\'s a sample Lymond quote (and no, this is <u>not</u> atypical):<blockquote>\\\\\"Don\\'t you think it\\'s time my family shared in my misfortunes, as Christians should? Then, vice is so costly: May dew or none, my brown and tender diamonds don\\'t engender, they dissolve. Immoderation, Mariotta, is a thief of money and intestinal joy, but who\\'d check it? Here I am, weeping soft tears of myrrh, to prove it.\\\\\"</blockquote>I rest my case. I also had a challenge following the political maneuvering and battles, although that may not be a problem for more historically savvy readers.<br><br>Several people told me that you just need to let the parts that you don\\'t understand roll over you. Ignore them and just go on, was their advice. And yes, that worked pretty well, but still, any book written as late as 1961 that needs to (and does!) have several guidebooks written about it to help readers get all the in-jokes and obscure quotes and references, maybe has a bit too much going on for its own good.<br><br>I should be fair and add that most people in the book talk like normal people. Even Lymond, when he\\'s not trying to be mysterious or evasive, can use plain speech. And if you\\'re willing to take on (or overlook) the difficult parts, there is <u>so much</u> in this book to love. Lymond\\'s adventures, as well as his problematic relationships with his brother; his second-in-command, Will Scott; a blind woman, Christian Stewart; and others make for incredible, sometimes humorous and often very exciting reading. <br><br>So, marvelous book, but minus a star for being a little too obscure and difficult and making me all irritated and surly for the first 100 pages, until I just got over it. :) One of these times I\\'m going to reread it, and maybe my rating will go up then.<br><br>Thanks so much to Marquise for the buddy read! <br><br>ETA: <a href=\\\\\"https://goodreads.com/book/show/112080.Queens__Play__The_Lymond_Chronicles___2_\\\\\" title=\\\\\"Queens\\' Play (The Lymond Chronicles, #2) by Dorothy Dunnett\\\\\" rel=\\\\\"noopener\\\\\">Queens\\' Play</a>, the second book in this series, is much easier to read--though still challenging--and incredibly gripping and rewarding.

There’s a method to Lymond’s madness. If you can stick with it, it does finally pay off. But the road to get there is often bumpy, difficult to traverse, with <i>occasional</i> glimmers of brilliance that help propel the reader forward.

A classical education, (perhaps even a master\\'s degree in English Literature and a facility with a number of languages) notwithstanding, a reader is not going to <i>fully</i> understand or appreciate this.

The fandom is passionate, but of plenty of folks, understandably, don’t get what the fuss is about. Dunnett makes no concessions to readers. You have to think about what you are reading. With Dunnett, it’s important to consider the possibilities and implications of each interaction—which can take you out of the story.<br /><br />Plus, Dunnett is given to quotations in Renaissance French, Spanish, and Latin without the benefit of translation (which can also take you out of the flow) And her hero frequently comes off as a terrible person, although he invariably has his reasons. <br /><br />But if you are willing to do what the author demands, (the thinking and the Latin Googling, and the adapting yourself to her style), what you get is a dazzling portrait of the High Renaissance, with an equally dazzling cast of characters at its heart. <br /><br />In Game of Kings, the first book of the Lymond Chronicles, Francis Crawford of Lymond, disgraced younger son of a noble Scottish family, returns to Scotland, an outlaw, after a long absence. The year is 1547, Henry VIII’s young son Edward is on the throne of England, and skirmishing between England and Scotland is happening all along the borders. <br /><br />With this background of turmoil, and at the head of a band of fellow outlaws, Francis will reunite with his estranged family, strike up a complex friendship with the heir to a great estate, and with his outlaws, interfere in the political workings of England and Scotland—but is he betraying his country or saving it, trying to clear his name, or just cause trouble? <br /><br />The thing that strikes you first is Dunnett’s prose. It is dense, rich, distinctive, full of allusion, implication, and subtlety. Often she will imply something rather than tell the reader outright. Her descriptions—of clothing, food, weather, are incredibly evocative.<br /><br />The second thing that strikes you is her hero, Francis. He starts off insufferable: a prosy, high-handed know-it-all, too clever and pretty for his own good, and in his second on-page appearance he breaks into his own mother’s castle, robs it, and sets it on fire. It’s hard to muster sympathy for him for the vast majority of the book. But nothing is as it appears, and if you are willing to put up with Francis, the unfolding of his story—including the purpose behind his actions—will hit you like a rock to the forehead late in the game, one of those fantastic ah-ha moments that every writer hopes to give their readers. <br /><br />And fortunately Francis is surrounded by a vivid and appealing supporting cast, in which one is happy to find a lot of amazing women. Francis’ indomitable mother, his friend the blind but dauntless Christian Stewart, the romantic Agnes Herries, and the severely practical Kate Somerville are standouts. <br /><br />Add to that a plot that ticks along like a good stopwatch, a dry, subtle sense of humor, and just a wonderfully romantic sensibility, without stooping to cliché, and you have a winning combination. Not romance in the sense of love or sex, although that plays a part. But romance in the sense of swordfights, last stands, desperate escapes, grand sacrifices, a larger-than-life hero. All those things can be found in Dunnett’s work, and she can and will dazzle you, like her hero, if you just give her time to do so.<br /><br />To conclude, I have two pieces of advice for readers just embarking on their first read of Game of Kings:<br /><br />1)\\\\tIf, after the first chapter, you find yourself asking, “Buy why was the pig drunk?” you aren’t reading closely enough. <br /><br />2)\\\\tBefore passing judgment on Francis, wait until you find out who the Spanish nobleman is. <br />\",\"rating\":5,\"shelving\":{\"shelf\":{\"name\":\"read\",\"webUrl\":\"https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/45755563?shelf=read\",\"__typename\":\"Shelf\"},\"taggings\":[],\"webUrl\":\"https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1609386753\",\"__typename\":\"Shelving\"},\"likeCount\":85,\"viewerHasLiked\":null,\"commentCount\":5},\"__typename\":\"BookReviewsEdge\"},{\"node\":{\"__typename\":\"Review\",\"id\":\"kca://review:goodreads/amzn1.gr.review:goodreads.v1.LfwHCbxiG8cx_oYZ2hhgHg\",\"creator\":{\"id\":4728718,\"imageUrlSquare\":\"https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/users/1553101944i/4728718._UX200_CR0,7,200,200_.jpg\",\"isAuthor\":false,\"viewerRelationshipStatus\":null,\"followersCount\":950,\"__typename\":\"User\",\"textReviewsCount\":1486,\"name\":\"Algernon (Darth Anyan)\",\"webUrl\":\"https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4728718-algernon-darth-anyan\",\"contributor\":null},\"recommendFor\":null,\"updatedAt\":1.681950053088E12,\"createdAt\":1.299764709E12,\"spoilerStatus\":false,\"lastRevisionAt\":1.641407404439E12,\"text\":\"Six stars out of five for Dorothy Dunnett. She\\'s in class of her own when it comes to historical fiction and, while I continue to enjoy the epics told by Bernard Cornwell or Patrick O\\'Brian (the ones I\\'m currently in the middle of), I have to admit that in a celebrity deathmatch they would come second place to the Lymond / Niccolo series. Fans of the author tend towards unbridled enthusiasm (witness the 4,42 median rating here on Goodreads - the highest I\\'ve come across so far, and the international conventions meeting in places of import from the books). So what is the secret of this amazing popularity, seeing as the number of votes is relatively low? I could point out to the erudition and the word plays that rival Umberto Eco, to the wild swashbuckling adventures that surpass even Alexandre Dumas, to the intricate puzzles and whodunnit investigations that pay tribute to Arthur Conan Doyle or Agatha Christie, the grand vision, panoramic scope that challenge Gone with the Wind and War and Peace, and last but not least the wild, absurd, disruptive sense of humour that reminds me of the best of Blackadder or Monty Python (<i> \\'We need to uthe thronger perthuathion. The men below are obviouthly in colluthion too.\\' </i> - Lord Grey channelling Michael Palin as Pontius Pilates). <br /><br />All these aspects are part of the attraction, but I believe above and beyond the technical skills and the richness of the setting, the books of Dorothy Dunnet are about passion : for history, for the people that made history and for living life to the full. Wikipedia mentions that the inception of the Lymond Chronicles came when Dunnett complained to her husband that she has run out of things to read, and he suggested she should write her own. Thus we are reading the kind of tale a voracious reader wrote for her own enjoyment, and we tag along with googly eyes and mouths open in wonder. As for the low number of votes : the books were written five decades ago, so they lack the exposure of newcomers on the scene. They are also too big for impulse buyers and too complex to be included in a school curriculum (maybe at university level). These factors combine to keep away the casual browser of library shelves, but attract the more dedicated readers of history and the ones who prefer sprawling, immersive adventures. And once you pass the initial reluctance to invest time and effort in 13 books you end up under Dunnett spell.<br /><br /><i> I wished to explore, within several books, the nature and experiences of a classical hero: a gifted leader whose star-crossed career, disturbing, hilarious, dangerous, I could follow in finest detail for ten years. And I wished to set him in the age of the Renaissance. </i><br /><br />Enters Francis Crawford of Lymond, younger son of the Coulter family. The year is 1547 and Scotland is like \\'a lark surrounded by crocodiles\\'. After a series of disastrous military campaigns, most of the nobles are either dead, prisoners across the Border or secretly in the pay of the English who claim the hand of the six year old Queen Mary in marriage to their own infant heir to the throne. At the start of the novel Francis is an outlaw, hunted across the realm for betraying his side to the English, and at the most basic level the plot can be resumed as the struggle of Francis to clear his name and discover who and how he was framed. Complicating the issue is the deadly rivalry between Francis and his older brother, the heir to the Coulter castle and lands, his responsibility in the death of their beloved sister, a budding romance with a blind heiress and a dysfunctional relationship with young and idealistic Will Scott, who wants to become an apprentice to the charysmatic outlaw leader.<br /><br /><b> The Game of Kings </b> reflects the battle for Scottish sovereignty through the language and tactics of chess. The analogy is deeply embedded at all the levels of the story - from the opening moves of Lymond stealing his mother\\'s jewels, burning the family castle and flirting with his brother\\'s wife, to his game of cat and mouse playing both sides against each other and stealing equally from the British and from the Scots, to the relative role of each piece on the board - passive kings and queens, fiery knights, besieged towers, wild horse runs or bishops betrayals.<br /><br /><i> The rybauldes, players of dyce And the messangers and corrours ought to be sette tofore the rook. For hit apperteyneth to the rook ... to have men convenable for to renne here and there for tenquire and espie the place and cyties that myght be contrarye to the kynge. </i><br /><br />Each chapter is prefaced by a reference to the game, written in old English and usually related to the current developments in the plot. As a side note, don\\'t get unnerved by the apparent obscurity of these introductions: the rest of the novel is written in plain English, or what Dunnett considers plain English in the context of the Renaissance: authentic Scots idiom seasoned with Latin, French, Italian, occasional German, Dutch and Spanish, verses from popular ballads and court poets, references to mythology and the equivalent of XVI century pop culture. It comes as no surprise that the Lymond / Nicollo Chronicles have spawned a two volume hefty companion book that references and translates and comments on all the trivia and all the research included in the original books. I am lucky to be familiar with the major European languages and with several modern Scottish authors, and to have the patience and the drive to solve / compose crossword puzzles, but even so I could not claim to have caught every nuance and every reference here. There\\'s just too damn many of them, every time a character opens his / her mouth, especially Lymond. But I had no problem following the gist of the conversations and the more subtle put-downs or barbed arrows of irony. The book practically begs for a re-read, both for spotting the later developments as they are first introduced (Lymond is always thinking and responding to his adversaries with several moves ahead of the game, like a true chess grandmaster) and for taking a breather from the frantic pacing and spend some leisure time with Wikipedia and with the reference books, savouring the more obscure points of the text.<br /><br />Coming back to Francis Lymond, the hero of the epic, I can understand but I cannot subscribe to the theory that he is a Gary Stu, unrealistic, uberpowerful and infallible. Yes, he is super smart, good looking, proficient with bow and sword, well read and a musical prodigy, but he is not supposed to be an ordinary Joe or a farmboy with a secret identity and a prophecy to fulfil, he is a Renaissance man, a natural born leader, a hero of his time period. Most of his talents can be explained by the fact that he is a second son, who inherits nothing and who has the pressing incentive to make his own place in the world, and by the circumstances forced on him: warrior, prisoner, galley slave, outlaw leader, spy, etc. In addition to his talents, there is the way Dunnett is treating him, like a bar of iron that is heated and re-heated in the fire of adversity and then moulded into shape with sledgehammers until the sword is sharp and deadly. (<i> This peculiar mental agility of yours has been no friend to you, has it? Without it, you might have survived, harmless, in a lukewarm limbo of drink and drugs and insipid women! </i>)<br /><br />He is an actor who struggles to give up his mask and change the role Fate and the lords of the land have written for him, he tries to do right by his followers and by his friends, but more often than not the results are hurtful to guilty and innocents alike. He makes mistakes, big ones, in keeping with his big struggles. He learns painfully that a leader is responsible for the lives of the people he involves in his plans and for the unforeseen consequences of his actions.<br /><br /><i> And now where are we? It\\'s difficult, isn\\'t it, to know whom to trust? Fide et diffide, in fact: and that is the moral of this little story. Be mistrustful, and you will live happy and die hated and be much more useful to me in between. </i><br /><br />In a great supporting role is Will Scott, who wants to learn from Lymond how to lead, how to be free of family and patriotic obligations, how to control his own life. Where Francis is practical and cynical, Will is idealistic and impulse driven. He is easily manipulated because he doesn\\'t follow through the moves of the chess game far enough into the future. Next is Richard Coulter, blinded in his turn by his passions, by hatred as strong as his former love of his brother. Insufficient or false knowledge drive both Will and Richard to pit themselves against Francis and his plans in a struggle that sees a new twist and reversal of fortunes every other page. Appearances are misleading and more than one killer may be interested in putting Francis Lymond out of the game. <br /><br />I could pick any of the major themes of the novel (<i> Patriotism is a fine hothouse for maggots. It breeds intolerance </i>, family relations, youth versus experience, law versus freedom) for a more indepth analysis, but I would like to pause for a moment on the way Dunnett treated gender roles in the novel. While men have the lion\\'s share of the action and women are generally relegated to passive roles as childbearers and household managers, the end result is refreshingly well balanced with the ladies more than holding their own in the unravelling of the mysteries and as adept in working from the shadows as the men are at swinging their axes and swords. Stately clan matron Sybilla Coulter, fiery Irish wife Mariotta Coulter, no-nonsense Lady Buccleuth, romantically challenged thirteen year old heiress Agnes Herries, malefic Margaret Douglas countess of Lennox, reliable and sensible Christian Stewart - they usually surpass their men in wit and fortitude. I particularly like the way Dunnett moulded her militant feminism to the social strictures of the period and didn\\'t try to endow her heroines with modern sensibilities. There is friction and misunderstanding between the genders, but there are also open channels of communication and the promise of a path together, side by side into the future. As George Douglas responds to Agnes Herries on the lack of romance in arranged marriages:<br /><br /><i> It\\'s pretty well a full-time job, these days, keeping a family housed and clothed and warm and protected. Doesn\\'t leave much time for poetry under the apple trees. But chivalry hasn\\'t gone: don\\'t think it. You\\'ll even find it paramount still with some people, but a trifle the worse for wear, because it\\'s not the best protection against an aggressive and materialistic world ... </i><br /><br />I\\'ve run out of bookmarks, and I still feel that I only touched on the surface of the story, that I didn\\'t stress enough how wildly entertaining and how intellectually stimulating the journey was. I\\'ve actually put off writing the review for a couple of months, hoping for inspiration to match the enthusiasm I felt reading it, but as I\\'m already halfway through book three of Lymond I was in danger of falling too far behind to ever reach closure. Maybe I\\'ll rewrite when I get around to reading the books again, this time back to back with the house of Niccolo, to see how they are related. Until then, I\\'ll leave you with these rambling notes.\",\"rating\":5,\"shelving\":{\"shelf\":{\"name\":\"read\",\"webUrl\":\"https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/4728718?shelf=read\",\"__typename\":\"Shelf\"},\"taggings\":[{\"tag\":{\"name\":\"2013\",\"webUrl\":\"https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/4728718?shelf=2013\",\"__typename\":\"Tag\"},\"__typename\":\"Tagging\"},{\"tag\":{\"name\":\"favorites\",\"webUrl\":\"https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/4728718?shelf=favorites\",\"__typename\":\"Tag\"},\"__typename\":\"Tagging\"}],\"webUrl\":\"https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/153390106\",\"__typename\":\"Shelving\"},\"likeCount\":82,\"viewerHasLiked\":null,\"commentCount\":21},\"__typename\":\"BookReviewsEdge\"},{\"node\":{\"__typename\":\"Review\",\"id\":\"kca://review:goodreads/amzn1.gr.review:goodreads.v1.MbPlJlEeA2qDhGgsgXC1sg\",\"creator\":{\"id\":31461418,\"imageUrlSquare\":\"https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/users/1613162122i/31461418._UX200_CR0,33,200,200_.jpg\",\"isAuthor\":false,\"viewerRelationshipStatus\":null,\"followersCount\":3732,\"__typename\":\"User\",\"textReviewsCount\":833,\"name\":\"Alienor ✘ French Frowner ✘\",\"webUrl\":\"https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/31461418-alienor-french-frowner\",\"contributor\":null},\"recommendFor\":null,\"updatedAt\":1.682586798537E12,\"createdAt\":1.50250313E12,\"spoilerStatus\":false,\"lastRevisionAt\":1.613389460176E12,\"text\":\"<img src=\\\\\"https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/hostedimages/1471482943i/20060243._SX540_.png\\\\\" class=\\\\\"gr-hostedUserImg\\\\\" loading=\\\\\"lazy\\\\\"><br><br>In order to clarify the situation with regard to said novel, let me first rehash what the two sides of the discussion have been saying : <br><br><b>Side \\'What the fuck is this\\'</b> : It\\'s obscure.

France wants the same and also put some pressure on England. <br />Mysterious Lymond returns to Scotland after the 5 year absence with a tarnished reputation. A grand political chess game begins. <br /><br />Lymond is an incredible protagonist. He is the most accomlished young man on the planet and always 5 steps ahead of every other character. And it would have been so frustrating if we had a first-person or third-person limited narration, but thankfully we don\\'t. We never see his POV, we only get glimpses of him through other characters��� eyes most of the tine. You never know what’s his plan and end game. Imagine Jack Sparrow if he was Scottish, overeducated and blond; but as drunk and scheming.<br /><br />What ensues next is a great adventure story of double crosses, triple crosses, politics, betrayals, swashbuckling and <s>melo</s>drama.<br />I\\'ve seen some reviewers calling this book pretentious and calling Dunnett a show-off but nothing could be further from the truth. But it is smart, subtle and requires attention from the reader. <br /><blockquote>“The Scot, the Frencheman, the Pope and heresie, overcommed by Trothe have had a fall. Again yes.”<br />“I wish to God,” said Gideon with mild exasperation, “that you’d talk—just once—in prose like other people.” </blockquote><br /><br />And the writing is so smart and gorgeous, sometimes very cheeky, the book is intricately plotted and the author respects her readers. It can be confusing at first, you are dropped into the middle of the war with a lot of actors. But it didn’t last long.<br />And I loved so many characters - papa Buccleuch, Christian Stewart, Somervilles, Agnes, mama bear, even grumpy Richard to name a few.<br />If you’re a fan of historical fiction with fun adventures, you need to give this a try!

I loved my first adventures with Lymond! </b> ⭐️ ⭐️ ⭐️ ⭐️ <br /><br />Francis Crawford of Lymond stands accused of many crimes, including deceit, drunkenness, murder, and treason. It’s 1547 when he returns to his native Scotland, just as it is threatened by an English invasion. <br /><br />Lymond leads a group of outlaws and dissidents to defend his land, as well as his name. Lymond is the second son, and second in line for any inheritance. <br /><br />Classical literature references abound, always testing me and adding fun when I actually knew one. Characters also abound, and we are on pins and needles as we wait to find out if Lymond is guilty or innocent. <br /><br />Lymond is in a fight to end all fights with his brother, and the outcome will determine if Lymond dies or is welcomed back into the fold of his family. <br /><br />Mary Queen of Scots is here, too, but too young to truly lead, which is why Lymond and men like him have to join up and join in to make sure Scotland remains a kingdom. <br /><br />There are true-to-history characters mixed in with fictional ones. Lymond is a main character to champion: complex, foolhardy, passionate, clever, impressive. <br /><br />The writing is rich and intricately detailed and is rather sumptuous overall. I’m so grateful there is a series to continue on with because I can’t wait to read Lymond’s next adventure, where he escorts Mary Queen of Scots to France. I’m so grateful this book and series was put on my radar because I have lots of adventure ahead of me! <br /><br />I received a complimentary copy.

He is my all-time favorite hero. He’s a 16th century polyglot scholar, soldier-for-hire, poet, musician, nobleman, and treasonous outlaw. He’s trying to clear his name (as a traitor to Scotland – his homeland), and yet his methods are so convoluted and often counter-productive that everything he does is a muddle. He is fascinating.<br /><br />I love the language that Dunnett uses to make Lymond and the rest of the characters come alive. Even their names have a ring to them. (\\\\\"Turkey Mat,\\\\\" \\\\\"the Lang Cleg,\\\\\" \\\\\"Johnnie Bullo,\\\\\" even “Sybilla”) At times the language can be too much. When characters speak in foreign tongues (or quote them), there is no translation. Most of it I can puzzle out, but it’s not easy. Plus there are constant references to things that I knew nothing about. Lymond’s opening line is: “I am a narwal looking for my virgin. I have sucked up the sea like Charybdis and failing other entertainment will spew it three times daily, for a few.” Believe it or not, there is actually a strong, coherent statement in that. But you need Wikipedia to puzzle it out.<br /><br />I love the drama of Lymond’s story. In particular I love his relationship with his brother, his mother, Will Scott, and the blind Christian Stewart. I love that they each both love him and despise him.<br /><br />I love the accurate historical details. I love the ‘feeling’ of the story. This is not a costume party book.<br /><br />I love everything about The Lymond Chronicles.

They covers so well its themes of betrayal and loss, love and loyalty, its stimulating mix of humor and adventure, and richness in characters and language.<br /><br />As a brief orientation, we are treated to the capers, conflicts, and liaisons of a mysterious outlaw in Scotland in the 1540’s, a time when the British and French are competing to eventually take over Scotland by setting up the marriage of their princes to the four-year old Queen Mary. Lymond is the second son of an aristocratic family but now reviled by his fellow Scots for betraying their forces to the invading British army five years earlier, resulting in tragic losses, including a sister. Even his own brother is after his hide. At the same time, he is an enemy to the Brits for signs of double-crossing them too. He takes up life on the run and living off banditry with a colorful cast of followers. His network of schemes and interventions is a confusing web which is subsumed under the metaphors of chess in the chapter structure. Whether Lymond is just a justifiable scoundrel in the face of all the brutal politics and personal guilt or has a secret noble cause is unclear for much of the book. <br /><br />I could tolerate such painful uncertainty because of the lively plot elements and plenty of lingering in the dialog and characters that make this such a rich and rewarding read. The arcane lingo took some getting used to render fluid comprehension, but as with reading Shakespeare a bit of looseness of the mind helps let the meaning flow. Unusual words and snatches of Latin and French can send you looking things up or lead you to my lazy shortcut of driving on with the context to carry the content. For example, you can just grok that “whaup and peewit” are birds and let that stand, and make your own meaning for “cheeks plimmed” and “fustian coat” But sometimes it was worth the effort of looking up some wonders, such as digging to find that “dance a vuelta on the widdy” is to dance a tango on the end of a noose.<br /><br />Ultimately, the tale had the feel of classic adventure tales like Zorro, Three Musketeers, and The Prisoner of Zenda and the charm of characterization reaching toward that of Patrick O’Brian. Some characters show their true selves or meet their just fate, and in that way the book is a romance. Those who meet ironic fates or stumble and bumble are part of the comedy. Underlying all is the tragedy of all the “collateral damage” and treachery among family and friends arising from Scotland’s unstable state among the wolves.

In particular, Pacat has modeled her character Laurent on the hero of this book, Francis Crawford of Lymond. <br /><br />For me, (for Damen), and I think for many fans, Laurent is the center of our attention. He captivates us, and though told through Damen’s perspective, the story truly revolves around him. <br /><br />The similarities between Lymond and Laurent are apparent. Both are fair-haired, blue-eyed second sons; both are master swordsmen, intensely loyal, and sharp-tongued leaders; both have wretched reputations which their enemies abuse in heartbreaking fashion. <br /><br />Laurent has an unwavering sense honor to match Damen’s, though he goes about it in backwards, sometimes counter-intuitive ways. He’s mysterious, hard to unravel, and impossible to predict. That’s what makes him so irresistible. And that’s what Lymond embodies. <br /> <br />The first time we meet him, we\\'re greeted lines like: <blockquote>\\\\n  <i>“Lymond, a man of wit and crooked felicities, bred to luxury and heir to a fortune, rode off serenely to Midcutler to break into his new sister-in-law’s castle.”</i>\\\\n</blockquote><i>Game of Kings</i> follows Lymond on a quest to restore his name to his fellow Scots, his story set against the English border disputes that plagued much of 16th century British history. <br /><br />If you liked watching Laurent go undercover at the inn to deliver a coded message and then make a daring escape over the rooftops, just wait until you see Lymond adopt a ridiculous alter ego and sack a castle with its own defenses. <br />If you got chills hearing Laurent chastise Aimeric, wait until you hear Lymond rip apart his foes with the glorious fury of his words. <br />If you cheered when the army marches in at the end of Vol. 2, wait until Lymond orchestrates victories, turning battlefields into chess games where only he controls the board. <br /><br />Here’s you’ll find life-or-death battles of wit, epic sword fights, and sweeping adventure. You’ll find bravery pitted against honor, and love against power. There’s tension, and beauty, and some of the most gorgeous writing ever written. <br /><br />The style is sparse, yet jam packed with information, making this a long, involved read. The references to literature, poetry and myths make understanding Lymond’s speech a slow, sometimes frustrating process, so much so that one character burst out, <i>“I wish to God that you’d talk – just once – in prose like other people!”</i> But don’t let that stop you. I read this book with a pen in hand, taking notes and folding pages, which I think helped. I also learned some cool new words like “sartorial,” “erumpent” and “susurrus.”<br /><br />From a gender perspective, it’s fantastic to read historical fiction where the women in the story are intelligent, vital characters. And icing on the cake, Dunnett codes Lymond as feminine while he’s clearly dominating everyone in the room. It’s amazing.<br /><br />Keep in mind – this is not a romance, it’s not dripping in homoeroticism and there’s very little sex. But for all the other wonderful reasons <i>Captive Prince</i> stands out above the rest, you’ll find here in Dororthy Dunnett’s series. <br /><br />During the wait for Kings Rising – and let’s be honest, when we all finish it the next day – Lymond and all his mysteries will be there, just waiting to be discovered. <br /><br />\",\"rating\":5,\"shelving\":{\"shelf\":{\"name\":\"read\",\"webUrl\":\"https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/24613363?shelf=read\",\"__typename\":\"Shelf\"},\"taggings\":[{\"tag\":{\"name\":\"atypical-heroes-and-heroines\",\"webUrl\":\"https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/24613363?shelf=atypical-heroes-and-heroines\",\"__typename\":\"Tag\"},\"__typename\":\"Tagging\"},{\"tag\":{\"name\":\"favorite-authors\",\"webUrl\":\"https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/24613363?shelf=favorite-authors\",\"__typename\":\"Tag\"},\"__typename\":\"Tagging\"},{\"tag\":{\"name\":\"favorites\",\"webUrl\":\"https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/24613363?shelf=favorites\",\"__typename\":\"Tag\"},\"__typename\":\"Tagging\"},{\"tag\":{\"name\":\"historical\",\"webUrl\":\"https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/24613363?shelf=historical\",\"__typename\":\"Tag\"},\"__typename\":\"Tagging\"},{\"tag\":{\"name\":\"jealous-of-first-time-readers\",\"webUrl\":\"https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/24613363?shelf=jealous-of-first-time-readers\",\"__typename\":\"Tag\"},\"__typename\":\"Tagging\"},{\"tag\":{\"name\":\"tears\",\"webUrl\":\"https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/24613363?shelf=tears\",\"__typename\":\"Tag\"},\"__typename\":\"Tagging\"},{\"tag\":{\"name\":\"warriors-soldiers-assassins\",\"webUrl\":\"https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/24613363?shelf=warriors-soldiers-assassins\",\"__typename\":\"Tag\"},\"__typename\":\"Tagging\"},{\"tag\":{\"name\":\"long-review\",\"webUrl\":\"https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/24613363?shelf=long-review\",\"__typename\":\"Tag\"},\"__typename\":\"Tagging\"}],\"webUrl\":\"https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1375704718\",\"__typename\":\"Shelving\"},\"likeCount\":31,\"viewerHasLiked\":null,\"commentCount\":10},\"__typename\":\"BookReviewsEdge\"},{\"node\":{\"__typename\":\"Review\",\"id\":\"kca://review:goodreads/amzn1.gr.review:goodreads.v1.q7jof1BJAyINBj8cUVHkzg\",\"creator\":{\"id\":37475550,\"imageUrlSquare\":\"https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/users/1493907866i/37475550._UX200_CR0,3,200,200_.jpg\",\"isAuthor\":false,\"viewerRelationshipStatus\":null,\"followersCount\":88,\"__typename\":\"User\",\"textReviewsCount\":561,\"name\":\"Laura Tenfingers\",\"webUrl\":\"https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/37475550-laura-tenfingers\",\"contributor\":null},\"recommendFor\":null,\"updatedAt\":1.682534435325E12,\"createdAt\":1.488164187201E12,\"spoilerStatus\":false,\"lastRevisionAt\":1.643120231195E12,\"text\":\"Even more fabulous than my first read.

What fun! Its 1547, Henry VIII is dead and his young son Edward VII sits on the throne, as does a very young Mary sit on the throne of Scotland. Negotiations were made and broken to betroth young Mary to Edward and cement the two countries - or will the Scots marry her off to the dauphin of France instead? Francis Crawford of Lymond, a disgraced nobleman accused of treason sneaks back into Scotland and thus the game begins (to clear his name? is he working for the English as a spy? to murder his brother so that Lymond can inherit the Culter estates?). <br /><br />Francis and his band of \\\\\"merry men\\\\\" immediately begin to wreak havoc, including setting fire to his brother\\'s estate after stealing the silver and holding the ladies (including his mother) at knife point for their jewelry. Throughout, Francis\\' brilliant wit, sarcasm and heroism keep the reader enthralled and at times laughing out loud. Lymond\\'s escapades take him up and down the breadth of Scotland as Dunnett slowly peels back the layers of her story and keeps the reader guessing until the very end, finishing in a trial of ups and downs, twists and turns ala Perry Mason. <br /><br />This is not an easy tale to get into, especially if you have no passing knowledge of the Tudor/Stuart courts and noblemen during the 16C. Dunnett also liberally sprinkles her text with quotes from Latin, French and Olde English, you can purchase her companion book if you must know every word and nuance but I did just fine without it -- just skip the Latin you won\\'t miss it.

A solid five stars, and I am now starting book two in the series, Queens\\' Play (Lymond Chronicles, 2). \",\"rating\":5,\"shelving\":{\"shelf\":{\"name\":\"read\",\"webUrl\":\"https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/1375548?shelf=read\",\"__typename\":\"Shelf\"},\"taggings\":[{\"tag\":{\"name\":\"historical-fiction\",\"webUrl\":\"https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/1375548?shelf=historical-fiction\",\"__typename\":\"Tag\"},\"__typename\":\"Tagging\"},{\"tag\":{\"name\":\"read-and-keep-for-a-reread\",\"webUrl\":\"https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/1375548?shelf=read-and-keep-for-a-reread\",\"__typename\":\"Tag\"},\"__typename\":\"Tagging\"}],\"webUrl\":\"https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/30682970\",\"__typename\":\"Shelving\"},\"likeCount\":27,\"viewerHasLiked\":null,\"commentCount\":15},\"__typename\":\"BookReviewsEdge\"},{\"node\":{\"__typename\":\"Review\",\"id\":\"kca://review:goodreads/amzn1.gr.review:goodreads.v1.NfzLxqT-Edj7s0FVPRTqjA\",\"creator\":{\"id\":27962805,\"imageUrlSquare\":\"https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/users/1475642755i/27962805._UX200_CR0,43,200,200_.jpg\",\"isAuthor\":false,\"viewerRelationshipStatus\":null,\"followersCount\":2574,\"__typename\":\"User\",\"textReviewsCount\":1189,\"name\":\"Choko\",\"webUrl\":\"https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/27962805-choko\",\"contributor\":null},\"recommendFor\":null,\"updatedAt\":1.653640665219E12,\"createdAt\":1.642445210286E12,\"spoilerStatus\":false,\"lastRevisionAt\":1.642476756379E12,\"text\":\"<b>*** 4.65 ***<br /><br /><i>“I wish to God,” said Gideon with mild exasperation, “that you’d talk—just once—in prose like other people.” </i></b><br /><br />What a storyteller! In my eyes, Dorothy Dunnett can do no wrong, but I am not blind to certain elements of her story construction which are not very desirable. She is a wordsmith, a great historical researcher, a creator of characters who are larger than life and walk the gray area between good and evil to a degree you are never sure where they stand, are smart, devious, and perfectly fit their time period. I have rarely read authors who manage to weave historical facts with fictional characters in such a seamless manner. Her immense knowledge of language and literature through the ages is breathtaking, and I for one truly appreciate it. However, most of those qualities are the same ones which seem to repel many a reader, and I understand that too. I am a firm believer that you should read whatever makes you happy and speaks to you. It just so happens that what some may perceive as cumbersome or bloated, I find beautiful and a gymnastics for the brain. I love the manner in which she creates her dialogue, despite not loving very much how she complicates the plot by linguistic misunderstandings and characters, whom I would like to shake and say \\\\\"just say what you mean, not just what is true, but misleading when taken out of context!!!\\\\\". That is actually my biggest pet peeve with all of her work. To me that leads to unnecessary manufactured drama, when there is enough drama in the story to begin with. But I know many of my favorite authors use this method, so I have learned to live with it.<br /><br />Otherwise the story, about Francis Crawford of Lymond of Scotland, second son of a noble family, during the Rough Wooing period between England and Scotland after the death of Henry the Viii, is brilliant and informative, but also managed to make me care deeply about some of the characters, to a degree I actually cried like a baby when one of them met her demise under very cruel circumstances. If I could have, I would have strangled her assailant with my own hands! Had bad dreams all night.... <br /><br />The final chapters include a trial, where the author brings one of the best arguments about the meaningless of the concept of Patriotism I have ever come across! Despite our best desires to accept that as many cultural differences as there are, we as people, as human beings are the same, when you bring the fervency of Patriotism in the mix, all best intentions of harmony between different peoples goes out of the window... I am not saying it is a bad thing, I am just saying it is a bit absurd when you look at the big picture... <br /><br />I will recommend this book to anyone who enjoys historical fiction which stays true to the period and tends to get a bit verbose, but in a good way, in my opinion. Of course, I accept that many would probably not enjoy it, so make sure you get an excerpt before you commit to buying it. <br /><br />❤️😃👍\",\"rating\":5,\"shelving\":{\"shelf\":{\"name\":\"read\",\"webUrl\":\"https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/27962805?shelf=read\",\"__typename\":\"Shelf\"},\"taggings\":[{\"tag\":{\"name\":\"historical-fiction\",\"webUrl\":\"https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/27962805?shelf=historical-fiction\",\"__typename\":\"Tag\"},\"__typename\":\"Tagging\"}],\"webUrl\":\"https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/4469290972\",\"__typename\":\"Shelving\"},\"likeCount\":24,\"viewerHasLiked\":null,\"commentCount\":0},\"__typename\":\"BookReviewsEdge\"},{\"node\":{\"__typename\":\"Review\",\"id\":\"kca://review:goodreads/amzn1.gr.review:goodreads.v1.pWDvM05yV6AjavA9Hq00_w\",\"creator\":{\"id\":4490376,\"imageUrlSquare\":\"https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/users/1499925811i/4490376.jpg\",\"isAuthor\":false,\"viewerRelationshipStatus\":null,\"followersCount\":0,\"__typename\":\"User\",\"textReviewsCount\":1074,\"name\":\"Sarah Mac\",\"webUrl\":\"https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4490376-sarah-mac\",\"contributor\":null},\"recommendFor\":null,\"updatedAt\":1.64599706085E12,\"createdAt\":1.318139611E12,\"spoilerStatus\":false,\"lastRevisionAt\":1.430413714E12,\"text\":\"<i>Star Trek</i>, deleted scene #674: <br><br><img src=\\\\\"https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/hostedimages/1428593644i/14449010.jpg\\\\\" class=\\\\\"gr-hostedUserImg\\\\\" loading=\\\\\"lazy\\\\\"><br><br>McCoy: \\\\\"He\\'s dead, Jim.\\\\\"<br>Kirk: \\\\\"Hey, what\\'s that stuck in his belly?\\\\\"<br>McCoy: \\\\\"<i>The Game of Kings: The Lymond Chronicles, Book 1</i>.

I have come across many readers who read and re-read her books, and I have a very clear memory of a bookish television, some years ago, where I saw an author speaking so articulately of how she and her husband would eagerly await publication of each new book, and read aloud to each other.<br /><br />I was sure that I would love them, but I hesitated to start reading because there were so many thick books, because I heard they were filled with complex plots, and a wealth of abstruse literary and historical allusions.<br /><br />In the end though, the arguments for reading became overwhelming.<br /><br />I picked up the first book, and now I can tell you that I loved it.<br /><br />It was complex, I’m quite sure there were things I missed, I wasn’t always entirely sure what was going on, but none of that mattered. I was captivated, I had to keep turning the pages, and it was lovely to be able to listen to someone so much cleverer than me, who was so articulate, who had so much to say about a subject that she loved, talking at very great length …<br /><br /><br /><br />The story opens in Scotland, in the 1540s.<br /><br />The king’s widow, Mary of Guise, rules the country as regent for her infant daughter, who the world will come to know as Mary Queen of Scots. England has a boy king, Edward VI, and his realm is governed by the Lord Protector. He wants the Queen of Scots to be the bride of his King, so that he will rule over the whole of island of Great Britain. His troops are making forays into Scotland, and some of the Lords of that country are inclined to throw their lots in with the English. The rulers of the great European powers are watching, eager to see what will happen, and thinking how that might benefit, what they might do to steers events.<br /><br />That’s an interesting point in history that I hadn’t considered too much, I don’t remember finding in fiction before, and it was lovely to follow a story in that period, so richly evoked.<br /><br />That story was sparked by the dramatic return from exile of Francis Crawford of Lymond: the younger son of a noble family, a lover of wit and game-playing, and a former galley-slave. It gradually became clear that he was on a mission to prove himself innocent of a six-year-old charge of treason, that he believed that one of three distinguished Englishmen held the key to the success or failure of that mission, but that to have any chance of success he must avoid a great many interested parties who want to take him captive – or worse.<br /><br />That’s as much as I can say about specifics of the plot.<br /><br />That plot is labyrinthine; and as I found my way through that labyrinth I saw so many different scenes, and I realised that there were so many different aspects to this story; there were twists and turns, shocks and revelations, tragedy and comedy, high drama and quiet reflection. Some things became clear, other things remained opaque, and often it was revealed that things were not as they seemed at all.<br /><br />The construction was so clever, and I loved that there were so many small details that could have slipped by unnoticed but would prove to be vitally important.<br /><br />The depth and the complexity of the characterisation is extraordinary; and a cast populated by fictional characters and historical figures lived and breathed.<br /><br />The world that they lived in is as well evoked; and I loved the cinematic sweep as well as perfectly framed close-ups. There is so a wealth of detail that makes up the bigger picture, and I could see no flaw in it; everything felt real and everything felt right.<br /><br />The use of language is wonderful, and the love of language is clear; it may be too much for some in Lymond’s verbal flourishes, but I loved them and I think that anyone with a love of words, anyone who regrets that some many lovely words in the English language are underused, would love them too.<br /><br />The success or failure of this book though, rested firmly on the shoulders of its central character. Francis Crawford of Lymond could be infuriating, but he had such charisma that I had to follow his story. He is incomparable, and the nearest I can come to any sort of comparison is to say that if you can imagine that the Count of Monte Christo had not been an honest sailor but an educated, cultured player of games …<br /><br />It took a little time for him to grow on me. I realised that there was a lot of back story to account for the way he chose to make his entrance, the ridiculous risks he took, the terrible antipathy between him and his elder brother; but even taking all of that into his account there were times when he struck me as juvenile and spoilt.<br /><br />As the story progressed though, he seemed to become more mature, and I came to realise that his history had left him damaged and deeply troubled. His relationship with one particular woman swung me completely to his side, even though I still wasn’t entirely sure where right and wrong lay in this story.<br /><br />As events unfolded I became more and more involved, and though I didn’t want the story to end I did want to know how it would end.<br /><br />That this is the first book in a series gave me a clue, and how I envy those readers who found this book when it was first published who didn’t even have that one small clue.<br /><br />Dorothy Dunnett played fair, but oh how clever she was. The drama kept on coming, even after a dramatic shift into a courtroom, and it was only at the very end of the book that I could stop, draw breath, and realise what an extraordinary journey this book had been.<br /><br />There is so much that could be said, and I feel that I’ve barely scratched the surface.<br /><br />I understand now why so many people love this series of books, have read and re-read them, have written at length.<br /><br />I’d love to do the same, I wish I’d started sooner, and now it’s time I started reading the next book.<br />\",\"rating\":5,\"shelving\":{\"shelf\":{\"name\":\"read\",\"webUrl\":\"https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/2050107?shelf=read\",\"__typename\":\"Shelf\"},\"taggings\":[],\"webUrl\":\"https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1946518193\",\"__typename\":\"Shelving\"},\"likeCount\":22,\"viewerHasLiked\":null,\"commentCount\":1},\"__typename\":\"BookReviewsEdge\"},{\"node\":{\"__typename\":\"Review\",\"id\":\"kca://review:goodreads/amzn1.gr.review:goodreads.v1.YPeI6wn2ETp0ZOjjCaREew\",\"creator\":{\"id\":5102,\"imageUrlSquare\":\"\",\"isAuthor\":false,\"viewerRelationshipStatus\":null,\"followersCount\":27,\"__typename\":\"User\",\"textReviewsCount\":69,\"name\":\"Andy\",\"webUrl\":\"https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5102-andy\",\"contributor\":null},\"recommendFor\":\"everyone!\",\"updatedAt\":1.618771829292E12,\"createdAt\":1.171655551E12,\"spoilerStatus\":false,\"lastRevisionAt\":1.171655962E12,\"text\":\"Ok, I don\\'t say this lightly but if one can make it through these books it will change your life.

The detail of Renaissance Europe, and the Ottoman Empire which draws you in through her writing as though you, the reader are actually there experiencing it. The best, most accurate sort of history lesson you can imagine wrapped into and around the fictional stories themselves.<br /><br />I hope you take a chance and read The Game of Kings, and I hope you LOVE it!

I can honestly say that this book had me enthralled from beginning to end, both times I’ve read it now. In fact it’s probably even better the second time around. <br /><br />Usually with a book of this size and calibre I find myself finished within a day or two. With Lymond however it’s serves you better to take it slow. I’ve mentioned in other reviews that I am dyslexic. Well this book is set in 1540’s Scotland and speech is mostly written in the way that it is spoken, accent and all. It’s a heavy undertaking without taking into account that the main character Lymond is a polyglot, and constantly slips in and out of different languages. He quotes ancient philosophy, plays, poems and all types of dramatic prose. In fact 90% of what comes out of his mouth is quoting someone or something else. His entire persona is theatrics and he always knows what to say and what role to play. So as you can imagine it is very difficult to read and make sense of. But once you get the flow and learn to listen to what Lymond is saying, things start to fall into place. He’s like watching a magician. You know you’re being tricked, you just can’t tell at what part he started tricking you. That being said, if you are reading the book and it’s not infuriating you, you might not be reading it closely or slowly enough. It is such a clever book and Francis is such a clever man. This is how you write an intelligent character. So many books have supposedly smart characters, but you are just told they are smart. Dunnett makes it immediately clear that Francis is ridiculously intelligent and makes no shy game of throwing that fact at you every time he is on the page. <br /><br />He’s one of my favourite characters, he encapsulates some of my favourite traits while being very unique. His lightning fast wit and wicked barbed tongue bring his dramatic and theatrical speeches down on his foes like a ton of bricks. I would hate to be on the receiving end of his verbal lashings. He is fantastically clever and the master of double dealings, feints, and secrets. He acting or playing a part almost of the time, and when he is showing his real self no one believes it. He is isolated whilst being beloved by his followers. He is condemned and judged by everyone. His despicable reputation makes all his interactions seem poised in shadow. <br />But there is a angelic quality to this butter haired rogue. There is a tender side, and a part of him that wants to do the right thing. Towards the end of the novel you see a much more vulnerable side to Francis. He’s hurt and almost out of options, yet he still doesn’t truly let the act drop. <br />I think what makes him the most interesting is that we never actually read from his POV. We aren’t in his head so we see everything from the rest of the colourful cast. I can see why, knowing how the trick is done ruins the fun. <br />We follow many different characters and see the plot spinning out from many different sides. I really enjoyed this aspect of the story as it made me root for pretty much all the sides at one point or another. It was great to see Lymond’s theatrics from the point of view of his foes. You never really know what Lymond has planned and he surprised me on countless occasions. You know he’s going to do something ridiculous that only he could pull off. Not only that, but some of his greatest feats in the book are executed flawlessly whilst he is incredibly intoxicated. <br />I’d also like to scream about the fact that he is 21 at the start of this book! <br />So yeah. I’m in love, obviously. <br /><br />It terms of plot I don’t want to say much at all. Just know that this is a book of secrets and lies. Political intrigue is a heavy focus as is strategy and mind games. If you don’t like these things in your historical fiction then you probably won’t enjoy this book. There is a handy list of everyone at the front of the book which is very useful as there is a large cast of characters and it is a little difficult to follow who is who at some points. Especially early on. History is also a major focus. The book uses real historical people and events and basically inputs the Crawford family right in the middle of it. But all the characters felt like they had purpose and real impact on the events that were taking place. The Crawford family and it’s dynamics are one of my favourite fictional family’s. They are all distinguished from one another and you really get the sense that they know how to wind each other up. <br /><br />I really wish more people would give this a go.

However you may well find yourself falling for Lymond too. <br /><br />When I last read book 2 I remember that I didn’t like it as much but I’m hoping I’ll like it better this time around.

Will finish later. At first, I didn\\'t quite know what to make of this book. It\\'s written in a sort of antique English brogue with frequent French and old English spellings that are hard to read. I have mostly skimmed the parts I don\\'t understand, being basically lazy, but when something was necessary for me to understand what was being said, I used Google, the ubiquitous explainer without which I could not live. I frequently wondered if it was worth all the effort, as it was initially very unclear where the plot was going. The first vignette is quite promising, however, being fairly comic and interesting if convoluted.... about a drunken pig and being smuggled into the country... the story progresses with one vignette or chapter after the other winding a circuitous route around the main character, a dashing, handsome, brilliant, and irrepressible noble by the name of Francis Crawford of Lymond, Master of Culter.<br /><br />As I waded through a bewildering array of scenarios and characters, I gradually became enthralled. I am now almost finished and while reading this afternoon, I found myself responding to the story in a visceral way and realized that Ms. Dunnett had quite magically wound the story around my emotions, pulling them out and into a great knot in my stomach as I wondered how Lymond was going to survive; knowing he would as there are five more books, my heart torn asunder by his battle with his brother, Richard. Now, on the cusp of being finished, I am already sad that this sometimes exasperating and exhausting journey is almost at an end.<br /><br />I am finished and have little to add, except the ending was most satisfactory. The hero is complicated and intelligent and the ideas and thinking are quite deep and profound. I am quite satisfied and am extremely glad I made the effort of reading it. Now, I think I will indulge in a little lightweight fantasy of Chicagoland Vampires and when in my car or walking my dogs, will listen to A Clash of Kings.\",\"rating\":5,\"shelving\":{\"shelf\":{\"name\":\"read\",\"webUrl\":\"https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/3080893?shelf=read\",\"__typename\":\"Shelf\"},\"taggings\":[{\"tag\":{\"name\":\"favorites\",\"webUrl\":\"https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/3080893?shelf=favorites\",\"__typename\":\"Tag\"},\"__typename\":\"Tagging\"},{\"tag\":{\"name\":\"historical\",\"webUrl\":\"https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/3080893?shelf=historical\",\"__typename\":\"Tag\"},\"__typename\":\"Tagging\"}],\"webUrl\":\"https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/92964976\",\"__typename\":\"Shelving\"},\"likeCount\":18,\"viewerHasLiked\":null,\"commentCount\":5},\"__typename\":\"BookReviewsEdge\"},{\"node\":{\"__typename\":\"Review\",\"id\":\"kca://review:goodreads/amzn1.gr.review:goodreads.v1.1UKge8hscVRwEFWC8qHdbg\",\"creator\":{\"id\":7035111,\"imageUrlSquare\":\"https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/users/1360466651i/7035111._UY200_CR78,0,200,200_.jpg\",\"isAuthor\":false,\"viewerRelationshipStatus\":null,\"followersCount\":177,\"__typename\":\"User\",\"textReviewsCount\":744,\"name\":\"Veronica \",\"webUrl\":\"https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7035111-veronica\",\"contributor\":null},\"recommendFor\":null,\"updatedAt\":1.673957890939E12,\"createdAt\":1.620062967586E12,\"spoilerStatus\":false,\"lastRevisionAt\":1.643396680168E12,\"text\":\"I finished this book, after many delays (two months\\' worth!), on Saturday.

I say: busy yourself no longer about him, for he is better condemned, and most harshly dead.\\\\\"</b><br /><br />After a five year absence, Francis Crawford of Lymond steps back onto the Scottish homeland that has branded him a murderer and a traitor. He does so for reasons of his own but they are reasons that the author masterfully plays out against the backdrop of history. It’s a time of great unrest for Scotland, caught between France and England who each want Scotland’s child queen for their own. Although Lymond and his family are fictitious, they bump up against a plethora of actual historical figures and it makes for a marvelous mix. <br /> <br />I’ve read this book three times in the last eight months so that should tell you something about how much I love it. I could happily sit down and start it all over again from the beginning because each time I read it I tease out a new, previously missed, connection. It’s not a book that will appeal to everyone, of course. What book does? But this one is likely hampered by the speech patterns of its main character, himself. Lymond has a manner of speaking that can be off-putting to many. He’s constantly making obscure literary and classical references and one could spend hours just trying to chase them all down on Google (it’s not necessary, so don’t do it unless you’re just really wanting to expand your knowledge of medieval arts and humanities). Take his very first line, for example:<br /><br /><i>\\\\\"I am a narwhal looking for my virgin. I have sucked up the sea like Charybdis and failing other entertainment will spew it three times daily, for a fee.\\\\\"</i><br /><br />It’s enough to make one throw the book across the room in exasperation – and, in fact, another prominent character in the story does eventually call Lymond out for not speaking in plain speech like a normal person. But there is a method to the madness and those who hang in there through the bumpy parts will be rewarded with a story full of court intrigue, double dealings, betrayals, loyalties, sword fights, romance, and some truly excellent verbal zingers. It has a seemingly slow start but then the author starts to peel back the layers and the tension starts to mount until, finally, I, at least, could not put it down. Not even on my third

Men want to be him or kill him. He makes it impossible for anyone to remain neutral in their regard for him. His tongue is as sharp as a rapier and his reticence about not sharing plans has even his most stout allies tearing their hair out in frustration. He is an accomplished polyglot and a master of disguise. He is a force of nature creating havoc for the ever shifting alliances between the Scots and the English. He does not join a side, does not trust any organization enough to actually call himself a member (nice to know I’m not the only one with this affliction). In 1547 Scotland he is a Renaissance Man and that does create it’s own problems. <br><br><i>”Versatility is one of the few human traits which are universally intolerable.

Actually more fun this time around.<br>———<br><b>2022</b>: Well then. I must say Dorothy Dunnett has <s>Dunnett</s> done it. “It” being a seemingly impossible feat of taking a book that I was physically restraining myself from throwing at the wall for the first 70 pages or so and making me love it by the end. <br><br>At the beginning I was reduced to angrily typing this* as I was seething from not understanding any accolades this book received from all my bookish friends:<br><blockquote>\\\\n<i>* “I wish to God,” said Gideon, with mild exasperation, “that you’d talk – just once – in prose like other people.”</i><br><br>Yeah, me too. I wish this book had been written in normal prose, like other authors manage. But apparently both me and Dorothy Dunnett eschew the knowledge that “Brevity is the soul of wit” because why use one word where an ornamental sentence containing a bit of an obscure medieval poetry reference (in French, probably) would do? And so we split into two warring camps here - (1) those who bask in the richness of the language and multilayered complexity of the story and (2) those who view this book as a bramble thicket of overwritten metaphors that grind repartees and battles to eyes-glazing-over stupor.</blockquote><br><b>Yeah, foolish Nataliya from a couple of weeks ago, I laugh at your frustrated naïveté</b>. But in my defense, Dunnett came up with sentences like this: <i>“Dumbness, flowing among them uncovered like a crocus in the snow the lost reprise of a hornpipe, pursuing its scratchy but dogged course in the musicians’ gallery.”</i> Or like this: <i>“The luminous eyes, apparently satisfied with their diet, released their grip.”</i><br><br>So can you blame me for that initial lapse in judgment? Lymond himself would agree, I’m sure.<br>————<br><blockquote> <img src=\\\\\"https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/hostedimages/1641281352i/32402413._SX540_.jpg\\\\\" width=\\\\\"400\\\\\" class=\\\\\"gr-hostedUserImg\\\\\" loading=\\\\\"lazy\\\\\"><br>(Whoever was responsible for those book covers that make this novel look like a cheap bodice-ripper should be hanged. Or quartered. Or both.)</blockquote><br>This book is a historical mystery of sorts, <b>slowly revealing to us the gradual redemption of what initially seems the most irredeemable character</b>. Francis Crawford of Lymond, he of the <i>“cornflower-blue”</i> eyes and a sharp tongue that never stops talking. A traitor and pariah who does not stoop at double-crossing, lying, corruption and even setting fire to his ancestral home while his own mother is inside. Or did it really happen this way? Dunnett will have you find out, slowly, deliberately, while only showing you Lymond through others’s eyes, making you infer his motivations from his actions while he is frustratingly opaque about them, while he plays a masterful chess game of politics too complicated to understand for the longest time, and all while he’s being rude and obnoxious in his obscure quotes-filled excessively erudite speech*.<br><blockquote>* <i>“I am a narwhal looking for my virgin. I have sucked up the sea like Charybdis and failing other entertainment will spew it three times daily, for a fee.”</i><br><br>See what I mean? It’s like he’s trying to drive you insane. And yes, that’s on purpose.</blockquote><br>And yet slowly, slowly the metaphorical layers are peeled off and you realize that not only have you, like pretty much everyone who spends more than five minutes in Lymond’s company, have fallen under the spell of his charisma but that so many things you assumed are wrong. <b>And by the time he starts speaking like less of a prick and more like the Renaissance man he is (seriously, there’s not a subject at which our Francis doesn’t fully excel at) you realize that he actually has quite a few interesting things to say</b> — culminating in that wonderful “patriotism sucks” (paraphrasing here, as you may gather) speech at the end. <br><blockquote>\\\\n<i> “That,” said Henry Lauder, closing his spectacles and throwing his pen in the wastepaper basket, “is a brain. If I were ten years younger and a lassie, I’d woo him myself.”</i><br><br>Don’t we all, Mr. Lauder, don’t we all. Get in line, and that line is long.</blockquote><br>————<br><blockquote> <img src=\\\\\"https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/hostedimages/1641281352i/32402414._SX540_.jpg\\\\\" width=\\\\\"400\\\\\" class=\\\\\"gr-hostedUserImg\\\\\" loading=\\\\\"lazy\\\\\">\\\\n</blockquote><br><br>This story is set during the “Rough Wooing” time in the 16th century, after English King Henry VIII died and the plans were concocted to annex Scotland by marrying the orphaned toddler Queen Mary to Henry’s young son, with Scotland pulled into different directions by England and France, and endless armed conflicts and squirmishes between the English and the Scots became the norm. And here’s the thing — <b>Dorothy Dunnett expect the readers to come to this story already reasonably versed in the history of that time</b>. I lucked out having recently read <a href=\\\\\"https://goodreads.com/book/show/10097.Queen_of_Scots_The_True_Life_of_Mary_Stuart\\\\\" title=\\\\\"Queen of Scots The True Life of Mary Stuart by John Guy\\\\\" rel=\\\\\"noopener\\\\\">Queen of Scots: The True Life of Mary Stuart</a>, but at the very least a through Wikipedia perusal may be quite helpful.

Her characters are so alive, they almost walk off the page — Lymond himself, his mother Sybilla, Gideon and Kate Somerville, Christian Stewart, Tom Erskine, Wat Buccleuch — you guys are all invited to dinner at my place. And even the infuriating ones gradually acquire surprising depths (looking at you, Richard of the grey eyeballs!), and get a bit of a redemption for foolish foolhardy choices (Will Scott, something tells me you will need your hand held for a few more years in life), and a gentle lessons in the simple truths of life and marriage (Mariotta, you stupid shallow girl).

And I have a confession to make: I no longer like it.<br /><br />Yes, I\\'m prepared for the public stoning and the flood of \\\\\"unlikes.\\\\\"<br /><br />But I don\\'t want to pretend I am still onboard this long-ago sunk ship and leave my old ratings keep that impression alive. The truth is, I\\'ve reread Lymond several times I didn\\'t even keep track of them all, and with each reread I liked it less and less. And less, and less . . . My GR records only register four rereads, but there were more, the last one was on my own and alone in 2020 during the Covid-19 pandemic and I didn\\'t register it on here. That reread showed me that I had ceased being a fan.<br /><br />I\\'ve had issues with Lymond since my first read, particularly with book 1 and book 6, but they started to grow from my second reread on, when I simply couldn\\'t overlook the mounting problems and decided to never reread the last book again. I kept to that until my last reread, when I reread bits and pieces of \\\\\"Checkmate,\\\\\" and that was probably the killing blow for any remnants of love left for the series. I did discuss it at length with one of my best friends, and I think that should\\'ve been the closure.<br /><br />I don\\'t know if I\\'m the only one, but I don\\'t know anyone else who has become this disenchanted to the point of stopped being a fan of Dorothy Dunnett. It\\'s a bit awkward to be an outlier, and I have tried to discuss my issues before, many times. I thought I would give it another try this April 2023 in a reread with a group of friends<b>*</b>; maybe there\\'d be some positive change this time, I thought, and . . . <br /><br />Part I of \\\\\"A Game of Kings\\\\\" is how long I lasted until I became exhausted and decided it wasn\\'t worth it trying to resurrect the dead. What is gone is gone and won\\'t be back. I\\'ve come to terms with that.<br /><br />So, with that context, here\\'s my updated review stating my reasons (most but not all, or it\\'d be even longer). There be spoilers, beware.<br /><br /><b>THE REVIEW:</b><br /><br />I’ve never liked those books—and TV shows—in which the writers felt that the readers need to have it all spelt out for them for a variety of reasons, mainly the assumption that they will miss it otherwise.<br /><br />And then I found Dorothy Dunnett and met the other extreme of the “dumbing it down for the masses” spectrum. That I didn’t like it either is evident, but my issue isn’t that she employs language that most of humanity won’t get. It’s what it does to the narrative.<br /><br />I won’t include here a summary of the plot, there are excellent reviews out there that have done it better than I could; instead I’ll talk about my own impressions, and so I’ll go point by point.<br /><br />THE PLOT: The story starts interestingly enough, wrenching some laughter from the readers via Lymond’s comical initial antics, and keeping the interest till the middle with a rapid succession of swashbuckling adventures that makes the delight of those of us that grew up crushing hard on d’Artagnan, Edmond Dantès, and Percy Blakeney. <br /><br />You begin to see in Francis Crawford of Lymond another potential classic hero to love. You start to make conjectures about the genesis of his mystifying feud with his elder brother, you mull earnestly over your own hypotheses that would explain things ranging from why he doesn’t kill his brother to why he seems to be courting his sister-in-law, you try to make sense of his mother’s baffling sang froid towards two sons that aim to rip each other’s throat, you laugh at Lymond’s abduction of a certain lady and the way he outmanoeuvres his pursuers, you admire his pluck, his ruthlessness, his apparent flexible morality, his devil-may-care attitude in playing chess with humans that results in the death of an innocent woman . . . By the time of the duel, you think you know—as much as you can surmise from the obscure narrative—who and what he is and what he may be doing or may have done.<br /><br />But then the last pages come. The courtroom comes. And it all goes down in a crash.<br /><br />The author that hadn’t given a fig for whether her readers would or wouldn’t grasp what she was saying and what the storyline was about, resorts to a literary technique that smells suspiciously of Agatha Christie, in my opinion. We find out that, oh no, it wasn’t precious Lymond after all, it was that weakling Dandy. That’s so, folks, the assassin was the butler all along, and with a stroke of the plume everything that had added some layers of greyness, of human fallibility and base demeanour is swept away from Lymond’s sheet, which is left lily-white clean. And what’s worse, it’s not even Lymond who unveils it; it’s his mother. There’s a word for that trope: character idealisation, or in plain slang, Mary Sue-ness. <br /><br />The courtroom wasn’t an appropriate closure, it was anticlimactic. With it, the reader’s laborious mental work during the entirety of the book just doesn’t pay off. You were lost and buried under the avalanche of rhymes and preciousness, and didn’t understand what the thing was about? Don’t worry, it will be explained, no, spelt out in detail, to you at the end during Lymond’s trial. Without his distracting rhyming (for the most part) and obtuse referencing, so you won’t miss a thing. Isn’t it just wonderful; all that worry that you were missing something was for naught, all that theorising and guessing was for naught, the author is telling you what happened, so the job is done for you. <br /><br />This I can’t forgive Dame Dorothy for. One star is lost.<br /><br />THE CHARACTERISATION OF THE HERO: Although I tend to prefer deeply flawed men with scores of layers, men who aren’t redeemed with a stroke of a magical plume and that know what they are, unapologetically so, yet still are likable because one dozen or two of their layers are relatable, very human, I can also love the more conventionally perfect brand of literary heroes. With a caveat: that they must be believable. There is where the characterisation of Lymond fails. He isn’t believable; not only is he extremely capable at everything under the sun, which itself alone would be enough to cast a fake varnish over his character, but he’s also so young for all these achievements and besides he\\'s physically impressive. Sure, there were—and are—some extraordinary souls that can leave us mere mortals with our jaws hanging low in amazement. But they also have their darker sides. Which is Francis’? Hard to tell from the way Dunnett has described him. He feels more like an idealised Renaissance man raised exponentially to the Nth degree: a Leonardo da Vinci with the handsomeness of Leonardo DiCaprio and the luck of Lucifer and an early fame to match Alexander the Great. <br /><br />His idiosyncratic speech doesn’t help much either, but would’ve been better taken in if not for Dunnett’s decision to spread the same merry rhymin’ and recitin’ across several pages and characters, which brings me to the next point.<br /><br />THE LANGUAGE: For many readers, language is the sole reason they can’t persevere with this book, and a good reason this is. A very good one.<br /><br />As a polyglot myself, I didn’t have excessive trouble with the quotes in French and Spanish, and could comprehend the Latin quotations as well, and the German and Italian, without needing the Dunnett companion. I was able to recognise the source of many of them from earlier readings of Spanish writers from the period and some Roman classics; they aren’t that unknown to a well-read person as the Olde English ones. The Middle-English quotes gave me more headaches because they were just too obscure. I don’t know if, were they from more known period sources like, say, Shakespeare, a greater number of readers would’ve gotten them, because he’s more accessible. But that’s not the case, the quotes she includes, without name of the source, aren’t readily recognisable, which may be due to the fact that they’re chess quotes, though not all of them are. <br /><br />Because of that, and the fact that the quotes can be skipped with no loss, I said that my issue isn’t the language itself as much as what it does to the narrative. I’m not sure I can explain this in a way that conveys exactly what I mean, but I’ll try. <br /><br />First things first, let’s state the bare facts: the quotations aren’t restricted to chapter openings. They are all over the place, everywhere. Second: Lymond can’t speak without a quote thrown in to save his life. Third: And it’s not only Lymond, other characters are afflicted with the Quotation Fever as well. Now my point: it’s excessive. If the literary references were for chapter openings or for reinforcing the chess-imagery only, then very good. If not that, then if the quotations were made to be a speech quirk of Lymond’s only, it’d be counted as a character trait, irritating or endearing depending on the reader’s taste but no more than that. But he’s not the only one that speaks like that, others do too, and that gives the impression of being in the company of actors, not of real people that existed at the time. The little foreign-language lines are too distracting even if you don’t read them, because they interrupt the flow of the dialogue and force you to either stop to try to understand it, or to skip them, so you read dialogue hop-hopping from one English phrase to the next. And though likely the Guides that were written to clarify these will disagree with me on this, I can say that a good number of them are just too random and don’t really add to the narrative. At times, it even reads like Dunnett was just showing off; there are lines that could support my point. <br /><br />It’s that sense of unreality brought in by that narrative style what I liked the least. The period description and the historical accuracy may be splendid, though I disagree here (they aren\\'t), but the characterisation, the language and Dunnett’s storytelling left me with the sensation of watching a mummer’s show instead of real people in real events, which I appreciate in historical fiction. I felt like the characters were actors performing for an audience, they spoke like actors for an audience, and the events unfold just like in a scripted play in which the characters are the puppets moved by a master puppeteer, not events that unfold naturally and suffer the setbacks of chance and human nature. Mummery, in sum, it felt like mummery. Artificial, implausible, not believable. <br /><br />So, to conclude, the book loses two more stars on account of the last points, and is left with two only. Now, let\\'s move to the much-lauded accuracy and research by Dunnett.<br /><br />THE ACCURACY: Fans of this series like to slavishly praise it for its supposed impeccable historical research, and yet, in the very first opening scene there\\'s already a historical error. And there\\'s another in the first chapter, so you can imagine how many more there are if there\\'s this many so early in the book; those who know the history of the 16th century will be able to spot at least three early enough, and that\\'s not a good sign.<br /><br />Added to this accuracy point is the historicity/historical plausibility part. Dunnett falls in the same trap as many other writers: she has her fictional character meet and be close to all the important real characters. It\\'s not as heavy-handed in this first book, but throughout the series Lymond becomes a Forrest Gump of the 1500s, going from here to there to meet all the Big Names of the period like he has a bucket list, going as far as Russia. Do you find all this credible? His connections to the Scottish court and relationship with the child Queen already stretch credulity, but what happens in the next books break all sense of plausibility. Who in the historical record for the 16th century is there that\\'s remotely as well-connected and well-travelled and well-accepted everywhere regardless of religion and race as Lymond is? Nobody. Some might not mind it and love the grand adventure aspect, but I do demand plausibility in my Hist-Fic. Mindset wise, Lymond doesn\\'t belong in his period either. He\\'s very modern-minded, a product of the 1960s than of the 1560s, not a man of his times.<br /><br />THE TREATMENT OF FEMALE CHARACTERS: In AGOK, there\\'s one woman who is Lymond\\'s match in every sense: Christian Stewart, the blind lady of Boghall. She was well-educated, very smart, well-connected, independent and enterprising in spite of her blindness, and the only one who could talk with Lymond in his convoluted language. And she was sacrificed for male angst.<br /><br />Yes, Christian Stewart\\'s fate was merely for Lymond to angst over. It\\'s the equivalent of using female rape so the hero can angst and wangst over it for all eternity in the book, as it later happens in another book in the series. I have seen arguments that if she had lived she\\'d have been a \\\\\"burden\\\\\" for Lymond. Ableist hogwash! She was capable on her own, and her disability would\\'ve actually been a good way to realistically portray the challenges someone like her would have to face, which would\\'ve made for more challenging but interesting plots than grooming Pippa to be another sacrifice.<br /><br />All the women in this series are sacrifices on the altar of Lymond, misogynistically used to create, nurture, and grow his angst and suicidality. Even Kate, who supposedly escapes this fate, in reality doesn\\'t. She\\'s also sacrificed and given a consolation prize in the end in the form of a man that she didn\\'t really need. She could\\'ve kept her Gideon, but that would\\'ve meant less angst for Saint Francis the Perfect.<br /><br />And this is merely in the first book, because every single book in this series right until the epilogue of \\\\\"Checkmate\\\\\" has a woman sacrificed for Lymond. The first book has two, the second book has one, the third book has one, the fourth book has one, the fifth book has one, the last book has two. This is a very troubling pattern in Dunnett\\'s writing that few seem to be bothered by. I am bothered by this, and always have been. The sacrifice of Christian was the benchmark for me even before that awful plot point in \\\\\"Checkmate,\\\\\" and the more I\\'ve reread this, the more troubling I find it. How is it possible that a series where women live for the hero be praised for being so good with female characters? Don\\'t readers see the issue?<br /><br />THE LANGUAGE II: Another aspect Dunnett is undeservedly praised for is the use of foreign languages. For a character who supposedly speaks so many languages and is a linguistic wunderkind, Dunnett\\'s use of foreign language for Lymond isn\\'t that good. In fact, in this first book, it\\'s shitty.<br /><br />Take the Don Luis scene, which is offensively racist and relies entirely on stereotypes. I can tell Dunnett never met a Spaniard in her life if she thinks Will\\'s name would be pronounced \\\\\"Huile\\\\\" by a Spanish speaker. On top of that, she used Spanish incorrectly, there\\'s wrong words wrongly \\\\\"translated,\\\\\" and the articles are incorrect as well; even when a line is correct, that\\'s not the Spanish that would be spoken in the 1500s (see Don Quixote in the original for a quick check). Where\\'s the vaunted accuracy and linguistic gift? Nowhere.<br /><br />And that\\'s only one scene with one foreign ethnicity, don\\'t get me started on the depiction of the \\\\\"Gypsies\\\\\" in this book that is racist as well. And no, you can\\'t say it\\'s the characters that are, because the POV is universal narrator, ergo an authorial choice. In other books, there\\'s also racial stereotyping and exoticisation that is authorial choice and not characters\\' views.<br /><br />I could go on with examples, but I think the above suffice to make my point. I\\'ve reread this series enough times to know there\\'s no turning back for me. Some series survive several rereads, but <i>The Lymond Chronicles</i> was the opposite for me, and that is it. Am I sad? No, not really. I\\'m happy that I can say I\\'m done, leave my thoughts out in the open, and move on. Plenty of books in the world to love yet!<br /><br />________________________<br /><b>*</b> <i>Thank you, Ryan, Nastya, Nataliya, Clodia, Alexandra, Justin, Temperance.

Lymond is a young man, exiled from Scotland for treason, who has now snuck back into the country and is busy making waves and causing trouble, for reasons that gradually are revealed. <br><br>Dorothy Dunnett uses chess terms as chapter titles and Middle English quotes about chess at the start of most chapters, and really this book is very much like one massive chess game, played by a master player.<br><br>Parts of <i>Game of Kings</i> were completely fascinating: I always enjoy reading about a person who has their own mysterious agenda, which they follow to the end while everyone around them sees only their small piece of the puzzle. This book is very well-written, and a lot of the scenes really came to life for me.

Lymond is a brilliant scholar as well as an athlete ― and musician, and excellent swordsman and archer, and . . . well, I\\'m not sure there\\'s anything he doesn\\'t do well. Except not be an asshole. So aside from being a bit of a Gary Stu, which I have absolutely no issues with when the book is good enough, Lymond is given to dialogue that includes various quotes in French or Latin (which Dunnett <i>never</i> bothers translating for you) and obscure literary references that may have been familiar to well-read people back in the 16th century but certainly aren\\'t well-known now. I was an English major in college, and most of this stuff I did not get AT ALL. <br><img src=\\\\\"https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/hostedimages/1404402760i/10233747.gif\\\\\" width=\\\\\"250\\\\\" height=\\\\\"280\\\\\" alt=\\\\\"description\\\\\" class=\\\\\"gr-hostedUserImg\\\\\" loading=\\\\\"lazy\\\\\"> <br>Here\\'s a sample Lymond quote (and no, this is <u>not</u> atypical):<blockquote>\\\\\"Don\\'t you think it\\'s time my family shared in my misfortunes, as Christians should? Then, vice is so costly: May dew or none, my brown and tender diamonds don\\'t engender, they dissolve. Immoderation, Mariotta, is a thief of money and intestinal joy, but who\\'d check it? Here I am, weeping soft tears of myrrh, to prove it.\\\\\"</blockquote>I rest my case. I also had a challenge following the political maneuvering and battles, although that may not be a problem for more historically savvy readers.<br><br>Several people told me that you just need to let the parts that you don\\'t understand roll over you. Ignore them and just go on, was their advice. And yes, that worked pretty well, but still, any book written as late as 1961 that needs to (and does!) have several guidebooks written about it to help readers get all the in-jokes and obscure quotes and references, maybe has a bit too much going on for its own good.<br><br>I should be fair and add that most people in the book talk like normal people. Even Lymond, when he\\'s not trying to be mysterious or evasive, can use plain speech. And if you\\'re willing to take on (or overlook) the difficult parts, there is <u>so much</u> in this book to love. Lymond\\'s adventures, as well as his problematic relationships with his brother; his second-in-command, Will Scott; a blind woman, Christian Stewart; and others make for incredible, sometimes humorous and often very exciting reading. <br><br>So, marvelous book, but minus a star for being a little too obscure and difficult and making me all irritated and surly for the first 100 pages, until I just got over it. :) One of these times I\\'m going to reread it, and maybe my rating will go up then.<br><br>Thanks so much to Marquise for the buddy read! <br><br>ETA: <a href=\\\\\"https://goodreads.com/book/show/112080.Queens__Play__The_Lymond_Chronicles___2_\\\\\" title=\\\\\"Queens\\' Play (The Lymond Chronicles, #2) by Dorothy Dunnett\\\\\" rel=\\\\\"noopener\\\\\">Queens\\' Play</a>, the second book in this series, is much easier to read--though still challenging--and incredibly gripping and rewarding.

Particular turns of phrase from scenes I’ve read over again – “I despised men who accepted their fate. I shaped mine twenty times and had it broken twenty times in my hands.” And more fundamental things. I remembered the fact of Lymond’s speech about patriotism, but not it’s chilling, blazing content. Yet when I got to it again, it rang my whole brain like a bell because it turns out I <i>did</i> remember, I just remembered so far down it felt like it came from me.<br /><br />It’s a book with speeches, let me just repeat that.<br /><br />Okay, some actual content. This is Scotland, 1547, conflict sparking with England, France circling. It’s a story of nations, but mostly it’s about the lost son coming home, about his brother’s marriage bending and bending until the cracks show, it’s about his extraordinary mother, and their friends, and a long, awful, painful coming in from the cold. I love them all <i>so much</i> I am helpless about it. This is a ridiculous, absurd book where the main character is incomprehensible 75% of the time if you don’t have a Ph.D. in sixteenth-century literature, and you don’t have the faintest idea what anything means for about 500 pages, and I love it as passionately and unreservedly as all its excesses demand. It\\'s about the flaw, the break, the shattering, and building strength from personal anialation. And in the last, a humanitarianism so strong, it feels brutal.<br /><br />...Nope, definitely don\\'t have it in me.\",\"rating\":5,\"shelving\":{\"shelf\":{\"name\":\"read\",\"webUrl\":\"https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/1836077?shelf=read\",\"__typename\":\"Shelf\"},\"taggings\":[{\"tag\":{\"name\":\"fiction\",\"webUrl\":\"https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/1836077?shelf=fiction\",\"__typename\":\"Tag\"},\"__typename\":\"Tagging\"},{\"tag\":{\"name\":\"historical\",\"webUrl\":\"https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/1836077?shelf=historical\",\"__typename\":\"Tag\"},\"__typename\":\"Tagging\"},{\"tag\":{\"name\":\"lgbt\",\"webUrl\":\"https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/1836077?shelf=lgbt\",\"__typename\":\"Tag\"},\"__typename\":\"Tagging\"}],\"webUrl\":\"https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/41128531\",\"__typename\":\"Shelving\"},\"likeCount\":96,\"viewerHasLiked\":null,\"commentCount\":4},\"__typename\":\"BookReviewsEdge\"},{\"node\":{\"__typename\":\"Review\",\"id\":\"kca://review:goodreads/amzn1.gr.review:goodreads.v1.FsxcPI2lrTx8eWuAhEhYmA\",\"creator\":{\"id\":3820197,\"imageUrlSquare\":\"https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/users/1383385041i/3820197.jpg\",\"isAuthor\":false,\"viewerRelationshipStatus\":null,\"followersCount\":1381,\"__typename\":\"User\",\"textReviewsCount\":600,\"name\":\"Jill\",\"webUrl\":\"https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3820197-jill\",\"contributor\":null},\"recommendFor\":null,\"updatedAt\":1.662886626942E12,\"createdAt\":1.404100027E12,\"spoilerStatus\":false,\"lastRevisionAt\":1.470434398861E12,\"text\":\"<br><br><b>In the hands of a <i>less</i>-skilled writer, this could have been a real page-turner</b><br><br><b>\\\\n  <i>The Game of Kings</i>\\\\n</b> has all the ingredients to make it an irresistible read: a romantic, handsome, complex hero, an exciting historical setting and era, family drama and politics, well-researched details and vivid descriptions, intrigue and mystery.<br><br>But like the hero, Lymond, the novel itself is in turns brilliant and frustrating. <br><br>Scotland, 1547.

The fandom is passionate, but of plenty of folks, understandably, don’t get what the fuss is about. Dunnett makes no concessions to readers. You have to think about what you are reading. With Dunnett, it’s important to consider the possibilities and implications of each interaction—which can take you out of the story.<br /><br />Plus, Dunnett is given to quotations in Renaissance French, Spanish, and Latin without the benefit of translation (which can also take you out of the flow) And her hero frequently comes off as a terrible person, although he invariably has his reasons. <br /><br />But if you are willing to do what the author demands, (the thinking and the Latin Googling, and the adapting yourself to her style), what you get is a dazzling portrait of the High Renaissance, with an equally dazzling cast of characters at its heart. <br /><br />In Game of Kings, the first book of the Lymond Chronicles, Francis Crawford of Lymond, disgraced younger son of a noble Scottish family, returns to Scotland, an outlaw, after a long absence. The year is 1547, Henry VIII’s young son Edward is on the throne of England, and skirmishing between England and Scotland is happening all along the borders. <br /><br />With this background of turmoil, and at the head of a band of fellow outlaws, Francis will reunite with his estranged family, strike up a complex friendship with the heir to a great estate, and with his outlaws, interfere in the political workings of England and Scotland—but is he betraying his country or saving it, trying to clear his name, or just cause trouble? <br /><br />The thing that strikes you first is Dunnett’s prose. It is dense, rich, distinctive, full of allusion, implication, and subtlety. Often she will imply something rather than tell the reader outright. Her descriptions—of clothing, food, weather, are incredibly evocative.<br /><br />The second thing that strikes you is her hero, Francis. He starts off insufferable: a prosy, high-handed know-it-all, too clever and pretty for his own good, and in his second on-page appearance he breaks into his own mother’s castle, robs it, and sets it on fire. It’s hard to muster sympathy for him for the vast majority of the book. But nothing is as it appears, and if you are willing to put up with Francis, the unfolding of his story—including the purpose behind his actions—will hit you like a rock to the forehead late in the game, one of those fantastic ah-ha moments that every writer hopes to give their readers. <br /><br />And fortunately Francis is surrounded by a vivid and appealing supporting cast, in which one is happy to find a lot of amazing women. Francis’ indomitable mother, his friend the blind but dauntless Christian Stewart, the romantic Agnes Herries, and the severely practical Kate Somerville are standouts. <br /><br />Add to that a plot that ticks along like a good stopwatch, a dry, subtle sense of humor, and just a wonderfully romantic sensibility, without stooping to cliché, and you have a winning combination. Not romance in the sense of love or sex, although that plays a part. But romance in the sense of swordfights, last stands, desperate escapes, grand sacrifices, a larger-than-life hero. All those things can be found in Dunnett’s work, and she can and will dazzle you, like her hero, if you just give her time to do so.<br /><br />To conclude, I have two pieces of advice for readers just embarking on their first read of Game of Kings:<br /><br />1)\\\\tIf, after the first chapter, you find yourself asking, “Buy why was the pig drunk?” you aren’t reading closely enough. <br /><br />2)\\\\tBefore passing judgment on Francis, wait until you find out who the Spanish nobleman is. <br />\",\"rating\":5,\"shelving\":{\"shelf\":{\"name\":\"read\",\"webUrl\":\"https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/45755563?shelf=read\",\"__typename\":\"Shelf\"},\"taggings\":[],\"webUrl\":\"https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1609386753\",\"__typename\":\"Shelving\"},\"likeCount\":85,\"viewerHasLiked\":null,\"commentCount\":5},\"__typename\":\"BookReviewsEdge\"},{\"node\":{\"__typename\":\"Review\",\"id\":\"kca://review:goodreads/amzn1.gr.review:goodreads.v1.LfwHCbxiG8cx_oYZ2hhgHg\",\"creator\":{\"id\":4728718,\"imageUrlSquare\":\"https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/users/1553101944i/4728718._UX200_CR0,7,200,200_.jpg\",\"isAuthor\":false,\"viewerRelationshipStatus\":null,\"followersCount\":951,\"__typename\":\"User\",\"textReviewsCount\":1487,\"name\":\"Algernon (Darth Anyan)\",\"webUrl\":\"https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4728718-algernon-darth-anyan\",\"contributor\":null},\"recommendFor\":null,\"updatedAt\":1.681950053088E12,\"createdAt\":1.299764709E12,\"spoilerStatus\":false,\"lastRevisionAt\":1.641407404439E12,\"text\":\"Six stars out of five for Dorothy Dunnett. She\\'s in class of her own when it comes to historical fiction and, while I continue to enjoy the epics told by Bernard Cornwell or Patrick O\\'Brian (the ones I\\'m currently in the middle of), I have to admit that in a celebrity deathmatch they would come second place to the Lymond / Niccolo series. Fans of the author tend towards unbridled enthusiasm (witness the 4,42 median rating here on Goodreads - the highest I\\'ve come across so far, and the international conventions meeting in places of import from the books). So what is the secret of this amazing popularity, seeing as the number of votes is relatively low? I could point out to the erudition and the word plays that rival Umberto Eco, to the wild swashbuckling adventures that surpass even Alexandre Dumas, to the intricate puzzles and whodunnit investigations that pay tribute to Arthur Conan Doyle or Agatha Christie, the grand vision, panoramic scope that challenge Gone with the Wind and War and Peace, and last but not least the wild, absurd, disruptive sense of humour that reminds me of the best of Blackadder or Monty Python (<i> \\'We need to uthe thronger perthuathion. The men below are obviouthly in colluthion too.\\' </i> - Lord Grey channelling Michael Palin as Pontius Pilates). <br /><br />All these aspects are part of the attraction, but I believe above and beyond the technical skills and the richness of the setting, the books of Dorothy Dunnet are about passion : for history, for the people that made history and for living life to the full. Wikipedia mentions that the inception of the Lymond Chronicles came when Dunnett complained to her husband that she has run out of things to read, and he suggested she should write her own. Thus we are reading the kind of tale a voracious reader wrote for her own enjoyment, and we tag along with googly eyes and mouths open in wonder. As for the low number of votes : the books were written five decades ago, so they lack the exposure of newcomers on the scene. They are also too big for impulse buyers and too complex to be included in a school curriculum (maybe at university level). These factors combine to keep away the casual browser of library shelves, but attract the more dedicated readers of history and the ones who prefer sprawling, immersive adventures. And once you pass the initial reluctance to invest time and effort in 13 books you end up under Dunnett spell.<br /><br /><i> I wished to explore, within several books, the nature and experiences of a classical hero: a gifted leader whose star-crossed career, disturbing, hilarious, dangerous, I could follow in finest detail for ten years. And I wished to set him in the age of the Renaissance. </i><br /><br />Enters Francis Crawford of Lymond, younger son of the Coulter family. The year is 1547 and Scotland is like \\'a lark surrounded by crocodiles\\'. After a series of disastrous military campaigns, most of the nobles are either dead, prisoners across the Border or secretly in the pay of the English who claim the hand of the six year old Queen Mary in marriage to their own infant heir to the throne. At the start of the novel Francis is an outlaw, hunted across the realm for betraying his side to the English, and at the most basic level the plot can be resumed as the struggle of Francis to clear his name and discover who and how he was framed. Complicating the issue is the deadly rivalry between Francis and his older brother, the heir to the Coulter castle and lands, his responsibility in the death of their beloved sister, a budding romance with a blind heiress and a dysfunctional relationship with young and idealistic Will Scott, who wants to become an apprentice to the charysmatic outlaw leader.<br /><br /><b> The Game of Kings </b> reflects the battle for Scottish sovereignty through the language and tactics of chess. The analogy is deeply embedded at all the levels of the story - from the opening moves of Lymond stealing his mother\\'s jewels, burning the family castle and flirting with his brother\\'s wife, to his game of cat and mouse playing both sides against each other and stealing equally from the British and from the Scots, to the relative role of each piece on the board - passive kings and queens, fiery knights, besieged towers, wild horse runs or bishops betrayals.<br /><br /><i> The rybauldes, players of dyce And the messangers and corrours ought to be sette tofore the rook. For hit apperteyneth to the rook ... to have men convenable for to renne here and there for tenquire and espie the place and cyties that myght be contrarye to the kynge. </i><br /><br />Each chapter is prefaced by a reference to the game, written in old English and usually related to the current developments in the plot. As a side note, don\\'t get unnerved by the apparent obscurity of these introductions: the rest of the novel is written in plain English, or what Dunnett considers plain English in the context of the Renaissance: authentic Scots idiom seasoned with Latin, French, Italian, occasional German, Dutch and Spanish, verses from popular ballads and court poets, references to mythology and the equivalent of XVI century pop culture. It comes as no surprise that the Lymond / Nicollo Chronicles have spawned a two volume hefty companion book that references and translates and comments on all the trivia and all the research included in the original books. I am lucky to be familiar with the major European languages and with several modern Scottish authors, and to have the patience and the drive to solve / compose crossword puzzles, but even so I could not claim to have caught every nuance and every reference here. There\\'s just too damn many of them, every time a character opens his / her mouth, especially Lymond. But I had no problem following the gist of the conversations and the more subtle put-downs or barbed arrows of irony. The book practically begs for a re-read, both for spotting the later developments as they are first introduced (Lymond is always thinking and responding to his adversaries with several moves ahead of the game, like a true chess grandmaster) and for taking a breather from the frantic pacing and spend some leisure time with Wikipedia and with the reference books, savouring the more obscure points of the text.<br /><br />Coming back to Francis Lymond, the hero of the epic, I can understand but I cannot subscribe to the theory that he is a Gary Stu, unrealistic, uberpowerful and infallible. Yes, he is super smart, good looking, proficient with bow and sword, well read and a musical prodigy, but he is not supposed to be an ordinary Joe or a farmboy with a secret identity and a prophecy to fulfil, he is a Renaissance man, a natural born leader, a hero of his time period. Most of his talents can be explained by the fact that he is a second son, who inherits nothing and who has the pressing incentive to make his own place in the world, and by the circumstances forced on him: warrior, prisoner, galley slave, outlaw leader, spy, etc. In addition to his talents, there is the way Dunnett is treating him, like a bar of iron that is heated and re-heated in the fire of adversity and then moulded into shape with sledgehammers until the sword is sharp and deadly. (<i> This peculiar mental agility of yours has been no friend to you, has it? Without it, you might have survived, harmless, in a lukewarm limbo of drink and drugs and insipid women! </i>)<br /><br />He is an actor who struggles to give up his mask and change the role Fate and the lords of the land have written for him, he tries to do right by his followers and by his friends, but more often than not the results are hurtful to guilty and innocents alike. He makes mistakes, big ones, in keeping with his big struggles. He learns painfully that a leader is responsible for the lives of the people he involves in his plans and for the unforeseen consequences of his actions.<br /><br /><i> And now where are we? It\\'s difficult, isn\\'t it, to know whom to trust? Fide et diffide, in fact: and that is the moral of this little story. Be mistrustful, and you will live happy and die hated and be much more useful to me in between. </i><br /><br />In a great supporting role is Will Scott, who wants to learn from Lymond how to lead, how to be free of family and patriotic obligations, how to control his own life. Where Francis is practical and cynical, Will is idealistic and impulse driven. He is easily manipulated because he doesn\\'t follow through the moves of the chess game far enough into the future. Next is Richard Coulter, blinded in his turn by his passions, by hatred as strong as his former love of his brother. Insufficient or false knowledge drive both Will and Richard to pit themselves against Francis and his plans in a struggle that sees a new twist and reversal of fortunes every other page. Appearances are misleading and more than one killer may be interested in putting Francis Lymond out of the game. <br /><br />I could pick any of the major themes of the novel (<i> Patriotism is a fine hothouse for maggots. It breeds intolerance </i>, family relations, youth versus experience, law versus freedom) for a more indepth analysis, but I would like to pause for a moment on the way Dunnett treated gender roles in the novel. While men have the lion\\'s share of the action and women are generally relegated to passive roles as childbearers and household managers, the end result is refreshingly well balanced with the ladies more than holding their own in the unravelling of the mysteries and as adept in working from the shadows as the men are at swinging their axes and swords. Stately clan matron Sybilla Coulter, fiery Irish wife Mariotta Coulter, no-nonsense Lady Buccleuth, romantically challenged thirteen year old heiress Agnes Herries, malefic Margaret Douglas countess of Lennox, reliable and sensible Christian Stewart - they usually surpass their men in wit and fortitude. I particularly like the way Dunnett moulded her militant feminism to the social strictures of the period and didn\\'t try to endow her heroines with modern sensibilities. There is friction and misunderstanding between the genders, but there are also open channels of communication and the promise of a path together, side by side into the future. As George Douglas responds to Agnes Herries on the lack of romance in arranged marriages:<br /><br /><i> It\\'s pretty well a full-time job, these days, keeping a family housed and clothed and warm and protected. Doesn\\'t leave much time for poetry under the apple trees. But chivalry hasn\\'t gone: don\\'t think it. You\\'ll even find it paramount still with some people, but a trifle the worse for wear, because it\\'s not the best protection against an aggressive and materialistic world ... </i><br /><br />I\\'ve run out of bookmarks, and I still feel that I only touched on the surface of the story, that I didn\\'t stress enough how wildly entertaining and how intellectually stimulating the journey was. I\\'ve actually put off writing the review for a couple of months, hoping for inspiration to match the enthusiasm I felt reading it, but as I\\'m already halfway through book three of Lymond I was in danger of falling too far behind to ever reach closure. Maybe I\\'ll rewrite when I get around to reading the books again, this time back to back with the house of Niccolo, to see how they are related. Until then, I\\'ll leave you with these rambling notes.\",\"rating\":5,\"shelving\":{\"shelf\":{\"name\":\"read\",\"webUrl\":\"https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/4728718?shelf=read\",\"__typename\":\"Shelf\"},\"taggings\":[{\"tag\":{\"name\":\"2013\",\"webUrl\":\"https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/4728718?shelf=2013\",\"__typename\":\"Tag\"},\"__typename\":\"Tagging\"},{\"tag\":{\"name\":\"favorites\",\"webUrl\":\"https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/4728718?shelf=favorites\",\"__typename\":\"Tag\"},\"__typename\":\"Tagging\"}],\"webUrl\":\"https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/153390106\",\"__typename\":\"Shelving\"},\"likeCount\":82,\"viewerHasLiked\":null,\"commentCount\":21},\"__typename\":\"BookReviewsEdge\"},{\"node\":{\"__typename\":\"Review\",\"id\":\"kca://review:goodreads/amzn1.gr.review:goodreads.v1.MbPlJlEeA2qDhGgsgXC1sg\",\"creator\":{\"id\":31461418,\"imageUrlSquare\":\"https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/users/1613162122i/31461418._UX200_CR0,33,200,200_.jpg\",\"isAuthor\":false,\"viewerRelationshipStatus\":null,\"followersCount\":3732,\"__typename\":\"User\",\"textReviewsCount\":834,\"name\":\"Alienor ✘ French Frowner ✘\",\"webUrl\":\"https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/31461418-alienor-french-frowner\",\"contributor\":null},\"recommendFor\":null,\"updatedAt\":1.682586798537E12,\"createdAt\":1.50250313E12,\"spoilerStatus\":false,\"lastRevisionAt\":1.613389460176E12,\"text\":\"<img src=\\\\\"https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/hostedimages/1471482943i/20060243._SX540_.png\\\\\" class=\\\\\"gr-hostedUserImg\\\\\" loading=\\\\\"lazy\\\\\"><br><br>In order to clarify the situation with regard to said novel, let me first rehash what the two sides of the discussion have been saying : <br><br><b>Side \\'What the fuck is this\\'</b> : It\\'s obscure.

Argh!)<br /><br />-------------------------<br />Mary Queen of Scots is just a young child, the coveted prize-bride for young king Edward of England with Scotland as dowry. France wants the same and also put some pressure on England. <br />Mysterious Lymond returns to Scotland after the 5 year absence with a tarnished reputation. A grand political chess game begins. <br /><br />Lymond is an incredible protagonist. He is the most accomlished young man on the planet and always 5 steps ahead of every other character. And it would have been so frustrating if we had a first-person or third-person limited narration, but thankfully we don\\'t. We never see his POV, we only get glimpses of him through other characters’ eyes most of the tine. You never know what’s his plan and end game.

But it is smart, subtle and requires attention from the reader. <br /><blockquote>“The Scot, the Frencheman, the Pope and heresie, overcommed by Trothe have had a fall. Again yes.”<br />“I wish to God,” said Gideon with mild exasperation, “that you’d talk—just once—in prose like other people.” </blockquote><br /><br />And the writing is so smart and gorgeous, sometimes very cheeky, the book is intricately plotted and the author respects her readers. It can be confusing at first, you are dropped into the middle of the war with a lot of actors. But it didn’t last long.<br />And I loved so many characters - papa Buccleuch, Christian Stewart, Somervilles, Agnes, mama bear, even grumpy Richard to name a few.<br />If you’re a fan of historical fiction with fun adventures, you need to give this a try!

It’s 1547 when he returns to his native Scotland, just as it is threatened by an English invasion. <br /><br />Lymond leads a group of outlaws and dissidents to defend his land, as well as his name. Lymond is the second son, and second in line for any inheritance. <br /><br />Classical literature references abound, always testing me and adding fun when I actually knew one. Characters also abound, and we are on pins and needles as we wait to find out if Lymond is guilty or innocent. <br /><br />Lymond is in a fight to end all fights with his brother, and the outcome will determine if Lymond dies or is welcomed back into the fold of his family. <br /><br />Mary Queen of Scots is here, too, but too young to truly lead, which is why Lymond and men like him have to join up and join in to make sure Scotland remains a kingdom. <br /><br />There are true-to-history characters mixed in with fictional ones. Lymond is a main character to champion: complex, foolhardy, passionate, clever, impressive. <br /><br />The writing is rich and intricately detailed and is rather sumptuous overall. I’m so grateful there is a series to continue on with because I can’t wait to read Lymond’s next adventure, where he escorts Mary Queen of Scots to France.

He is my all-time favorite hero. He’s a 16th century polyglot scholar, soldier-for-hire, poet, musician, nobleman, and treasonous outlaw. He’s trying to clear his name (as a traitor to Scotland – his homeland), and yet his methods are so convoluted and often counter-productive that everything he does is a muddle. He is fascinating.<br /><br />I love the language that Dunnett uses to make Lymond and the rest of the characters come alive. Even their names have a ring to them. (\\\\\"Turkey Mat,\\\\\" \\\\\"the Lang Cleg,\\\\\" \\\\\"Johnnie Bullo,\\\\\" even “Sybilla”) At times the language can be too much. When characters speak in foreign tongues (or quote them), there is no translation. Most of it I can puzzle out, but it’s not easy. Plus there are constant references to things that I knew nothing about. Lymond’s opening line is: “I am a narwal looking for my virgin. I have sucked up the sea like Charybdis and failing other entertainment will spew it three times daily, for a few.” Believe it or not, there is actually a strong, coherent statement in that. But you need Wikipedia to puzzle it out.<br /><br />I love the drama of Lymond’s story. In particular I love his relationship with his brother, his mother, Will Scott, and the blind Christian Stewart. I love that they each both love him and despise him.<br /><br />I love the accurate historical details. I love the ‘feeling’ of the story.

They covers so well its themes of betrayal and loss, love and loyalty, its stimulating mix of humor and adventure, and richness in characters and language.<br /><br />As a brief orientation, we are treated to the capers, conflicts, and liaisons of a mysterious outlaw in Scotland in the 1540’s, a time when the British and French are competing to eventually take over Scotland by setting up the marriage of their princes to the four-year old Queen Mary. Lymond is the second son of an aristocratic family but now reviled by his fellow Scots for betraying their forces to the invading British army five years earlier, resulting in tragic losses, including a sister. Even his own brother is after his hide. At the same time, he is an enemy to the Brits for signs of double-crossing them too. He takes up life on the run and living off banditry with a colorful cast of followers. His network of schemes and interventions is a confusing web which is subsumed under the metaphors of chess in the chapter structure. Whether Lymond is just a justifiable scoundrel in the face of all the brutal politics and personal guilt or has a secret noble cause is unclear for much of the book. <br /><br />I could tolerate such painful uncertainty because of the lively plot elements and plenty of lingering in the dialog and characters that make this such a rich and rewarding read. The arcane lingo took some getting used to render fluid comprehension, but as with reading Shakespeare a bit of looseness of the mind helps let the meaning flow. Unusual words and snatches of Latin and French can send you looking things up or lead you to my lazy shortcut of driving on with the context to carry the content. For example, you can just grok that “whaup and peewit” are birds and let that stand, and make your own meaning for “cheeks plimmed” and “fustian coat” But sometimes it was worth the effort of looking up some wonders, such as digging to find that “dance a vuelta on the widdy” is to dance a tango on the end of a noose.<br /><br />Ultimately, the tale had the feel of classic adventure tales like Zorro, Three Musketeers, and The Prisoner of Zenda and the charm of characterization reaching toward that of Patrick O’Brian. Some characters show their true selves or meet their just fate, and in that way the book is a romance. Those who meet ironic fates or stumble and bumble are part of the comedy. Underlying all is the tragedy of all the “collateral damage” and treachery among family and friends arising from Scotland’s unstable state among the wolves.

In particular, Pacat has modeled her character Laurent on the hero of this book, Francis Crawford of Lymond. <br /><br />For me, (for Damen), and I think for many fans, Laurent is the center of our attention. He captivates us, and though told through Damen’s perspective, the story truly revolves around him. <br /><br />The similarities between Lymond and Laurent are apparent. Both are fair-haired, blue-eyed second sons; both are master swordsmen, intensely loyal, and sharp-tongued leaders; both have wretched reputations which their enemies abuse in heartbreaking fashion. <br /><br />Laurent has an unwavering sense honor to match Damen’s, though he goes about it in backwards, sometimes counter-intuitive ways. He’s mysterious, hard to unravel, and impossible to predict. That’s what makes him so irresistible. And that’s what Lymond embodies. <br /> <br />The first time we meet him, we\\'re greeted lines like: <blockquote>\\\\n  <i>“Lymond, a man of wit and crooked felicities, bred to luxury and heir to a fortune, rode off serenely to Midcutler to break into his new sister-in-law’s castle.”</i>\\\\n</blockquote><i>Game of Kings</i> follows Lymond on a quest to restore his name to his fellow Scots, his story set against the English border disputes that plagued much of 16th century British history. <br /><br />If you liked watching Laurent go undercover at the inn to deliver a coded message and then make a daring escape over the rooftops, just wait until you see Lymond adopt a ridiculous alter ego and sack a castle with its own defenses. <br />If you got chills hearing Laurent chastise Aimeric, wait until you hear Lymond rip apart his foes with the glorious fury of his words. <br />If you cheered when the army marches in at the end of Vol. 2, wait until Lymond orchestrates victories, turning battlefields into chess games where only he controls the board. <br /><br />Here’s you’ll find life-or-death battles of wit, epic sword fights, and sweeping adventure. You’ll find bravery pitted against honor, and love against power. There’s tension, and beauty, and some of the most gorgeous writing ever written. <br /><br />The style is sparse, yet jam packed with information, making this a long, involved read. The references to literature, poetry and myths make understanding Lymond’s speech a slow, sometimes frustrating process, so much so that one character burst out, <i>“I wish to God that you’d talk – just once – in prose like other people!”</i> But don’t let that stop you. I read this book with a pen in hand, taking notes and folding pages, which I think helped. I also learned some cool new words like “sartorial,” “erumpent” and “susurrus.”<br /><br />From a gender perspective, it’s fantastic to read historical fiction where the women in the story are intelligent, vital characters. And icing on the cake, Dunnett codes Lymond as feminine while he’s clearly dominating everyone in the room. It’s amazing.<br /><br />Keep in mind – this is not a romance, it’s not dripping in homoeroticism and there’s very little sex. But for all the other wonderful reasons <i>Captive Prince</i> stands out above the rest, you’ll find here in Dororthy Dunnett’s series. <br /><br />During the wait for Kings Rising – and let’s be honest, when we all finish it the next day – Lymond and all his mysteries will be there, just waiting to be discovered. <br /><br />\",\"rating\":5,\"shelving\":{\"shelf\":{\"name\":\"read\",\"webUrl\":\"https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/24613363?shelf=read\",\"__typename\":\"Shelf\"},\"taggings\":[{\"tag\":{\"name\":\"atypical-heroes-and-heroines\",\"webUrl\":\"https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/24613363?shelf=atypical-heroes-and-heroines\",\"__typename\":\"Tag\"},\"__typename\":\"Tagging\"},{\"tag\":{\"name\":\"favorite-authors\",\"webUrl\":\"https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/24613363?shelf=favorite-authors\",\"__typename\":\"Tag\"},\"__typename\":\"Tagging\"},{\"tag\":{\"name\":\"favorites\",\"webUrl\":\"https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/24613363?shelf=favorites\",\"__typename\":\"Tag\"},\"__typename\":\"Tagging\"},{\"tag\":{\"name\":\"historical\",\"webUrl\":\"https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/24613363?shelf=historical\",\"__typename\":\"Tag\"},\"__typename\":\"Tagging\"},{\"tag\":{\"name\":\"jealous-of-first-time-readers\",\"webUrl\":\"https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/24613363?shelf=jealous-of-first-time-readers\",\"__typename\":\"Tag\"},\"__typename\":\"Tagging\"},{\"tag\":{\"name\":\"tears\",\"webUrl\":\"https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/24613363?shelf=tears\",\"__typename\":\"Tag\"},\"__typename\":\"Tagging\"},{\"tag\":{\"name\":\"warriors-soldiers-assassins\",\"webUrl\":\"https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/24613363?shelf=warriors-soldiers-assassins\",\"__typename\":\"Tag\"},\"__typename\":\"Tagging\"},{\"tag\":{\"name\":\"long-review\",\"webUrl\":\"https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/24613363?shelf=long-review\",\"__typename\":\"Tag\"},\"__typename\":\"Tagging\"}],\"webUrl\":\"https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1375704718\",\"__typename\":\"Shelving\"},\"likeCount\":31,\"viewerHasLiked\":null,\"commentCount\":10},\"__typename\":\"BookReviewsEdge\"},{\"node\":{\"__typename\":\"Review\",\"id\":\"kca://review:goodreads/amzn1.gr.review:goodreads.v1.q7jof1BJAyINBj8cUVHkzg\",\"creator\":{\"id\":37475550,\"imageUrlSquare\":\"https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/users/1493907866i/37475550._UX200_CR0,3,200,200_.jpg\",\"isAuthor\":false,\"viewerRelationshipStatus\":null,\"followersCount\":88,\"__typename\":\"User\",\"textReviewsCount\":561,\"name\":\"Laura Tenfingers\",\"webUrl\":\"https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/37475550-laura-tenfingers\",\"contributor\":null},\"recommendFor\":null,\"updatedAt\":1.682534435325E12,\"createdAt\":1.488164187201E12,\"spoilerStatus\":false,\"lastRevisionAt\":1.643120231195E12,\"text\":\"Even more fabulous than my first read.

What fun! Its 1547, Henry VIII is dead and his young son Edward VII sits on the throne, as does a very young Mary sit on the throne of Scotland. Negotiations were made and broken to betroth young Mary to Edward and cement the two countries - or will the Scots marry her off to the dauphin of France instead? Francis Crawford of Lymond, a disgraced nobleman accused of treason sneaks back into Scotland and thus the game begins (to clear his name? is he working for the English as a spy? to murder his brother so that Lymond can inherit the Culter estates?). <br /><br />Francis and his band of \\\\\"merry men\\\\\" immediately begin to wreak havoc, including setting fire to his brother\\'s estate after stealing the silver and holding the ladies (including his mother) at knife point for their jewelry.

In my eyes, Dorothy Dunnett can do no wrong, but I am not blind to certain elements of her story construction which are not very desirable. She is a wordsmith, a great historical researcher, a creator of characters who are larger than life and walk the gray area between good and evil to a degree you are never sure where they stand, are smart, devious, and perfectly fit their time period. I have rarely read authors who manage to weave historical facts with fictional characters in such a seamless manner. Her immense knowledge of language and literature through the ages is breathtaking, and I for one truly appreciate it. However, most of those qualities are the same ones which seem to repel many a reader, and I understand that too. I am a firm believer that you should read whatever makes you happy and speaks to you. It just so happens that what some may perceive as cumbersome or bloated, I find beautiful and a gymnastics for the brain. I love the manner in which she creates her dialogue, despite not loving very much how she complicates the plot by linguistic misunderstandings and characters, whom I would like to shake and say \\\\\"just say what you mean, not just what is true, but misleading when taken out of context!!!\\\\\". That is actually my biggest pet peeve with all of her work. To me that leads to unnecessary manufactured drama, when there is enough drama in the story to begin with. But I know many of my favorite authors use this method, so I have learned to live with it.<br /><br />Otherwise the story, about Francis Crawford of Lymond of Scotland, second son of a noble family, during the Rough Wooing period between England and Scotland after the death of Henry the Viii, is brilliant and informative, but also managed to make me care deeply about some of the characters, to a degree I actually cried like a baby when one of them met her demise under very cruel circumstances. If I could have, I would have strangled her assailant with my own hands! Had bad dreams all night.... <br /><br />The final chapters include a trial, where the author brings one of the best arguments about the meaningless of the concept of Patriotism I have ever come across! Despite our best desires to accept that as many cultural differences as there are, we as people, as human beings are the same, when you bring the fervency of Patriotism in the mix, all best intentions of harmony between different peoples goes out of the window... I am not saying it is a bad thing, I am just saying it is a bit absurd when you look at the big picture... <br /><br />I will recommend this book to anyone who enjoys historical fiction which stays true to the period and tends to get a bit verbose, but in a good way, in my opinion. Of course, I accept that many would probably not enjoy it, so make sure you get an excerpt before you commit to buying it. <br /><br />❤️😃👍\",\"rating\":5,\"shelving\":{\"shelf\":{\"name\":\"read\",\"webUrl\":\"https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/27962805?shelf=read\",\"__typename\":\"Shelf\"},\"taggings\":[{\"tag\":{\"name\":\"historical-fiction\",\"webUrl\":\"https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/27962805?shelf=historical-fiction\",\"__typename\":\"Tag\"},\"__typename\":\"Tagging\"}],\"webUrl\":\"https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/4469290972\",\"__typename\":\"Shelving\"},\"likeCount\":24,\"viewerHasLiked\":null,\"commentCount\":0},\"__typename\":\"BookReviewsEdge\"},{\"node\":{\"__typename\":\"Review\",\"id\":\"kca://review:goodreads/amzn1.gr.review:goodreads.v1.pWDvM05yV6AjavA9Hq00_w\",\"creator\":{\"id\":4490376,\"imageUrlSquare\":\"https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/users/1499925811i/4490376.jpg\",\"isAuthor\":false,\"viewerRelationshipStatus\":null,\"followersCount\":0,\"__typename\":\"User\",\"textReviewsCount\":1074,\"name\":\"Sarah Mac\",\"webUrl\":\"https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4490376-sarah-mac\",\"contributor\":null},\"recommendFor\":null,\"updatedAt\":1.64599706085E12,\"createdAt\":1.318139611E12,\"spoilerStatus\":false,\"lastRevisionAt\":1.430413714E12,\"text\":\"<i>Star Trek</i>, deleted scene #674: <br><br><img src=\\\\\"https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/hostedimages/1428593644i/14449010.jpg\\\\\" class=\\\\\"gr-hostedUserImg\\\\\" loading=\\\\\"lazy\\\\\"><br><br>McCoy: \\\\\"He\\'s dead, Jim.\\\\\"<br>Kirk: \\\\\"Hey, what\\'s that stuck in his belly?\\\\\"<br>McCoy: \\\\\"<i>The Game of Kings: The Lymond Chronicles, Book 1</i>.

I have come across many readers who read and re-read her books, and I have a very clear memory of a bookish television, some years ago, where I saw an author speaking so articulately of how she and her husband would eagerly await publication of each new book, and read aloud to each other.<br /><br />I was sure that I would love them, but I hesitated to start reading because there were so many thick books, because I heard they were filled with complex plots, and a wealth of abstruse literary and historical allusions.<br /><br />In the end though, the arguments for reading became overwhelming.<br /><br />I picked up the first book, and now I can tell you that I loved it.<br /><br />It was complex, I’m quite sure there were things I missed, I wasn’t always entirely sure what was going on, but none of that mattered.

He wants the Queen of Scots to be the bride of his King, so that he will rule over the whole of island of Great Britain. His troops are making forays into Scotland, and some of the Lords of that country are inclined to throw their lots in with the English. The rulers of the great European powers are watching, eager to see what will happen, and thinking how that might benefit, what they might do to steers events.<br /><br />That’s an interesting point in history that I hadn’t considered too much, I don’t remember finding in fiction before, and it was lovely to follow a story in that period, so richly evoked.<br /><br />That story was sparked by the dramatic return from exile of Francis Crawford of Lymond: the younger son of a noble family, a lover of wit and game-playing, and a former galley-slave. It gradually became clear that he was on a mission to prove himself innocent of a six-year-old charge of treason, that he believed that one of three distinguished Englishmen held the key to the success or failure of that mission, but that to have any chance of success he must avoid a great many interested parties who want to take him captive – or worse.<br /><br />That’s as much as I can say about specifics of the plot.<br /><br />That plot is labyrinthine; and as I found my way through that labyrinth I saw so many different scenes, and I realised that there were so many different aspects to this story; there were twists and turns, shocks and revelations, tragedy and comedy, high drama and quiet reflection. Some things became clear, other things remained opaque, and often it was revealed that things were not as they seemed at all.<br /><br />The construction was so clever, and I loved that there were so many small details that could have slipped by unnoticed but would prove to be vitally important.<br /><br />The depth and the complexity of the characterisation is extraordinary; and a cast populated by fictional characters and historical figures lived and breathed.<br /><br />The world that they lived in is as well evoked; and I loved the cinematic sweep as well as perfectly framed close-ups. There is so a wealth of detail that makes up the bigger picture, and I could see no flaw in it; everything felt real and everything felt right.<br /><br />The use of language is wonderful, and the love of language is clear; it may be too much for some in Lymond’s verbal flourishes, but I loved them and I think that anyone with a love of words, anyone who regrets that some many lovely words in the English language are underused, would love them too.<br /><br />The success or failure of this book though, rested firmly on the shoulders of its central character. Francis Crawford of Lymond could be infuriating, but he had such charisma that I had to follow his story. He is incomparable, and the nearest I can come to any sort of comparison is to say that if you can imagine that the Count of Monte Christo had not been an honest sailor but an educated, cultured player of games …<br /><br />It took a little time for him to grow on me. I realised that there was a lot of back story to account for the way he chose to make his entrance, the ridiculous risks he took, the terrible antipathy between him and his elder brother; but even taking all of that into his account there were times when he struck me as juvenile and spoilt.<br /><br />As the story progressed though, he seemed to become more mature, and I came to realise that his history had left him damaged and deeply troubled. His relationship with one particular woman swung me completely to his side, even though I still wasn’t entirely sure where right and wrong lay in this story.<br /><br />As events unfolded I became more and more involved, and though I didn’t want the story to end I did want to know how it would end.<br /><br />That this is the first book in a series gave me a clue, and how I envy those readers who found this book when it was first published who didn’t even have that one small clue.<br /><br />Dorothy Dunnett played fair, but oh how clever she was. The drama kept on coming, even after a dramatic shift into a courtroom, and it was only at the very end of the book that I could stop, draw breath, and realise what an extraordinary journey this book had been.<br /><br />There is so much that could be said, and I feel that I’ve barely scratched the surface.<br /><br />I understand now why so many people love this series of books, have read and re-read them, have written at length.<br /><br />I’d love to do the same, I wish I’d started sooner, and now it’s time I started reading the next book.<br />\",\"rating\":5,\"shelving\":{\"shelf\":{\"name\":\"read\",\"webUrl\":\"https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/2050107?shelf=read\",\"__typename\":\"Shelf\"},\"taggings\":[],\"webUrl\":\"https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1946518193\",\"__typename\":\"Shelving\"},\"likeCount\":22,\"viewerHasLiked\":null,\"commentCount\":1},\"__typename\":\"BookReviewsEdge\"},{\"node\":{\"__typename\":\"Review\",\"id\":\"kca://review:goodreads/amzn1.gr.review:goodreads.v1.YPeI6wn2ETp0ZOjjCaREew\",\"creator\":{\"id\":5102,\"imageUrlSquare\":\"\",\"isAuthor\":false,\"viewerRelationshipStatus\":null,\"followersCount\":27,\"__typename\":\"User\",\"textReviewsCount\":69,\"name\":\"Andy\",\"webUrl\":\"https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5102-andy\",\"contributor\":null},\"recommendFor\":\"everyone!\",\"updatedAt\":1.618771829292E12,\"createdAt\":1.171655551E12,\"spoilerStatus\":false,\"lastRevisionAt\":1.171655962E12,\"text\":\"Ok, I don\\'t say this lightly but if one can make it through these books it will change your life.

Sir Alastair Dunnett, because without your suggestion there might never have been written The Game of Kings; the first book in a series of 6 books jointly referred to as the Lymond Chronicles.

Human characters that you love, you hate, you care about; and not just the main characters, but all the characters because Dunnett makes them ALL come alive. Then add the background. The detail of Renaissance Europe, and the Ottoman Empire which draws you in through her writing as though you, the reader are actually there experiencing it. The best, most accurate sort of history lesson you can imagine wrapped into and around the fictional stories themselves.<br /><br />I hope you take a chance and read The Game of Kings, and I hope you LOVE it!

I can honestly say that this book had me enthralled from beginning to end, both times I’ve read it now. In fact it’s probably even better the second time around. <br /><br />Usually with a book of this size and calibre I find myself finished within a day or two. With Lymond however it’s serves you better to take it slow. I’ve mentioned in other reviews that I am dyslexic. Well this book is set in 1540’s Scotland and speech is mostly written in the way that it is spoken, accent and all. It’s a heavy undertaking without taking into account that the main character Lymond is a polyglot, and constantly slips in and out of different languages. He quotes ancient philosophy, plays, poems and all types of dramatic prose. In fact 90% of what comes out of his mouth is quoting someone or something else. His entire persona is theatrics and he always knows what to say and what role to play. So as you can imagine it is very difficult to read and make sense of. But once you get the flow and learn to listen to what Lymond is saying, things start to fall into place. He’s like watching a magician. You know you’re being tricked, you just can’t tell at what part he started tricking you. That being said, if you are reading the book and it’s not infuriating you, you might not be reading it closely or slowly enough. It is such a clever book and Francis is such a clever man. This is how you write an intelligent character. So many books have supposedly smart characters, but you are just told they are smart. Dunnett makes it immediately clear that Francis is ridiculously intelligent and makes no shy game of throwing that fact at you every time he is on the page. <br /><br />He’s one of my favourite characters, he encapsulates some of my favourite traits while being very unique. His lightning fast wit and wicked barbed tongue bring his dramatic and theatrical speeches down on his foes like a ton of bricks. I would hate to be on the receiving end of his verbal lashings. He is fantastically clever and the master of double dealings, feints, and secrets. He acting or playing a part almost of the time, and when he is showing his real self no one believes it. He is isolated whilst being beloved by his followers. He is condemned and judged by everyone. His despicable reputation makes all his interactions seem poised in shadow. <br />But there is a angelic quality to this butter haired rogue. There is a tender side, and a part of him that wants to do the right thing. Towards the end of the novel you see a much more vulnerable side to Francis. He’s hurt and almost out of options, yet he still doesn’t truly let the act drop. <br />I think what makes him the most interesting is that we never actually read from his POV. We aren’t in his head so we see everything from the rest of the colourful cast. I can see why, knowing how the trick is done ruins the fun. <br />We follow many different characters and see the plot spinning out from many different sides. I really enjoyed this aspect of the story as it made me root for pretty much all the sides at one point or another. It was great to see Lymond’s theatrics from the point of view of his foes. You never really know what Lymond has planned and he surprised me on countless occasions. You know he’s going to do something ridiculous that only he could pull off. Not only that, but some of his greatest feats in the book are executed flawlessly whilst he is incredibly intoxicated. <br />I’d also like to scream about the fact that he is 21 at the start of this book! <br />So yeah. I’m in love, obviously. <br /><br />It terms of plot I don’t want to say much at all. Just know that this is a book of secrets and lies. Political intrigue is a heavy focus as is strategy and mind games. If you don’t like these things in your historical fiction then you probably won’t enjoy this book. There is a handy list of everyone at the front of the book which is very useful as there is a large cast of characters and it is a little difficult to follow who is who at some points. Especially early on. History is also a major focus. The book uses real historical people and events and basically inputs the Crawford family right in the middle of it. But all the characters felt like they had purpose and real impact on the events that were taking place. The Crawford family and it’s dynamics are one of my favourite fictional family’s. They are all distinguished from one another and you really get the sense that they know how to wind each other up. <br /><br />I really wish more people would give this a go. Even just this first book. You could definitely read this first book as a stand-alone. However you may well find yourself falling for Lymond too. <br /><br />When I last read book 2 I remember that I didn’t like it as much but I’m hoping I’ll like it better this time around. I know what I’m getting into at least.\",\"rating\":5,\"shelving\":{\"shelf\":{\"name\":\"read\",\"webUrl\":\"https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/26480778?shelf=read\",\"__typename\":\"Shelf\"},\"taggings\":[{\"tag\":{\"name\":\"read-in-2018\",\"webUrl\":\"https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/26480778?shelf=read-in-2018\",\"__typename\":\"Tag\"},\"__typename\":\"Tagging\"},{\"tag\":{\"name\":\"read-in-2022\",\"webUrl\":\"https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/26480778?shelf=read-in-2022\",\"__typename\":\"Tag\"},\"__typename\":\"Tagging\"},{\"tag\":{\"name\":\"favourite\",\"webUrl\":\"https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/26480778?shelf=favourite\",\"__typename\":\"Tag\"},\"__typename\":\"Tagging\"}],\"webUrl\":\"https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/2074674374\",\"__typename\":\"Shelving\"},\"likeCount\":20,\"viewerHasLiked\":null,\"commentCount\":0},\"__typename\":\"BookReviewsEdge\"},{\"node\":{\"__typename\":\"Review\",\"id\":\"kca://review:goodreads/amzn1.gr.review:goodreads.v1.V657Vbvbn-MV7WGC2m2S9Q\",\"creator\":{\"id\":3395391,\"imageUrlSquare\":\"https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/users/1595337239i/3395391._UX200_CR0,0,200,200_.jpg\",\"isAuthor\":false,\"viewerRelationshipStatus\":null,\"followersCount\":73,\"__typename\":\"User\",\"textReviewsCount\":479,\"name\":\"DayDreamer\",\"webUrl\":\"https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3395391-daydreamer\",\"contributor\":null},\"recommendFor\":null,\"updatedAt\":1.56908103966E12,\"createdAt\":1.370212568E12,\"spoilerStatus\":false,\"lastRevisionAt\":1.467609257E12,\"text\":\"Wow.<br /><br />I hadn\\'t done that in a while.

Will finish later. At first, I didn\\'t quite know what to make of this book. It\\'s written in a sort of antique English brogue with frequent French and old English spellings that are hard to read. I have mostly skimmed the parts I don\\'t understand, being basically lazy, but when something was necessary for me to understand what was being said, I used Google, the ubiquitous explainer without which I could not live. I frequently wondered if it was worth all the effort, as it was initially very unclear where the plot was going. The first vignette is quite promising, however, being fairly comic and interesting if convoluted.... about a drunken pig and being smuggled into the country... the story progresses with one vignette or chapter after the other winding a circuitous route around the main character, a dashing, handsome, brilliant, and irrepressible noble by the name of Francis Crawford of Lymond, Master of Culter.<br /><br />As I waded through a bewildering array of scenarios and characters, I gradually became enthralled. I am now almost finished and while reading this afternoon, I found myself responding to the story in a visceral way and realized that Ms. Dunnett had quite magically wound the story around my emotions, pulling them out and into a great knot in my stomach as I wondered how Lymond was going to survive; knowing he would as there are five more books, my heart torn asunder by his battle with his brother, Richard. Now, on the cusp of being finished, I am already sad that this sometimes exasperating and exhausting journey is almost at an end.<br /><br />I am finished and have little to add, except the ending was most satisfactory. The hero is complicated and intelligent and the ideas and thinking are quite deep and profound. I am quite satisfied and am extremely glad I made the effort of reading it. Now, I think I will indulge in a little lightweight fantasy of Chicagoland Vampires and when in my car or walking my dogs, will listen to A Clash of Kings.\",\"rating\":5,\"shelving\":{\"shelf\":{\"name\":\"read\",\"webUrl\":\"https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/3080893?shelf=read\",\"__typename\":\"Shelf\"},\"taggings\":[{\"tag\":{\"name\":\"favorites\",\"webUrl\":\"https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/3080893?shelf=favorites\",\"__typename\":\"Tag\"},\"__typename\":\"Tagging\"},{\"tag\":{\"name\":\"historical\",\"webUrl\":\"https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/3080893?shelf=historical\",\"__typename\":\"Tag\"},\"__typename\":\"Tagging\"}],\"webUrl\":\"https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/92964976\",\"__typename\":\"Shelving\"},\"likeCount\":18,\"viewerHasLiked\":null,\"commentCount\":5},\"__typename\":\"BookReviewsEdge\"},{\"node\":{\"__typename\":\"Review\",\"id\":\"kca://review:goodreads/amzn1.gr.review:goodreads.v1.1UKge8hscVRwEFWC8qHdbg\",\"creator\":{\"id\":7035111,\"imageUrlSquare\":\"https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/users/1360466651i/7035111._UY200_CR78,0,200,200_.jpg\",\"isAuthor\":false,\"viewerRelationshipStatus\":null,\"followersCount\":177,\"__typename\":\"User\",\"textReviewsCount\":744,\"name\":\"Veronica \",\"webUrl\":\"https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7035111-veronica\",\"contributor\":null},\"recommendFor\":null,\"updatedAt\":1.673957890939E12,\"createdAt\":1.620062967586E12,\"spoilerStatus\":false,\"lastRevisionAt\":1.643396680168E12,\"text\":\"I finished this book, after many delays (two months\\' worth!), on Saturday. And you know what? I\\'m going right back in for a reread. I underestimated this book or, at least, I was focusing on the wrong things. There were layers I wasn\\'t even aware of and now I\\'m heading back in to catch all the clues I missed. I\\'ll rate this when I\\'m done with my reread. :-)<br /><br />ETA: Finished third reading 1/28/2022.<br /><br /><b>\\\\\"Such a man is Crawford of Lymond: such a man this land may pray never to see again in the difficult ways of her history. I say: busy yourself no longer about him, for he is better condemned, and most harshly dead.\\\\\"</b><br /><br />After a five year absence, Francis Crawford of Lymond steps back onto the Scottish homeland that has branded him a murderer and a traitor. He does so for reasons of his own but they are reasons that the author masterfully plays out against the backdrop of history. It’s a time of great unrest for Scotland, caught between France and England who each want Scotland’s child queen for their own. Although Lymond and his family are fictitious, they bump up against a plethora of actual historical figures and it makes for a marvelous mix. <br /> <br />I’ve read this book three times in the last eight months so that should tell you something about how much I love it. I could happily sit down and start it all over again from the beginning because each time I read it I tease out a new, previously missed, connection. It’s not a book that will appeal to everyone, of course. What book does? But this one is likely hampered by the speech patterns of its main character, himself. Lymond has a manner of speaking that can be off-putting to many. He’s constantly making obscure literary and classical references and one could spend hours just trying to chase them all down on Google (it’s not necessary, so don’t do it unless you’re just really wanting to expand your knowledge of medieval arts and humanities). Take his very first line, for example:<br /><br /><i>\\\\\"I am a narwhal looking for my virgin. I have sucked up the sea like Charybdis and failing other entertainment will spew it three times daily, for a fee.\\\\\"</i><br /><br />It’s enough to make one throw the book across the room in exasperation – and, in fact, another prominent character in the story does eventually call Lymond out for not speaking in plain speech like a normal person. But there is a method to the madness and those who hang in there through the bumpy parts will be rewarded with a story full of court intrigue, double dealings, betrayals, loyalties, sword fights, romance, and some truly excellent verbal zingers. It has a seemingly slow start but then the author starts to peel back the layers and the tension starts to mount until, finally, I, at least, could not put it down. Not even on my third read.\",\"rating\":5,\"shelving\":{\"shelf\":{\"name\":\"read\",\"webUrl\":\"https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/7035111?shelf=read\",\"__typename\":\"Shelf\"},\"taggings\":[{\"tag\":{\"name\":\"historical-fiction\",\"webUrl\":\"https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/7035111?shelf=historical-fiction\",\"__typename\":\"Tag\"},\"__typename\":\"Tagging\"}],\"webUrl\":\"https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1056411296\",\"__typename\":\"Shelving\"},\"likeCount\":16,\"viewerHasLiked\":null,\"commentCount\":10},\"__typename\":\"BookReviewsEdge\"}],\"pageInfo\":{\"prevPageToken\":\"NDM3MDksMTE5OTI1MjY3NTAwMA\",\"nextPageToken\":\"MTYyNywxNjIwMDYyOTY3NTg2\",\"__typename\":\"PageInfo\"},\"__typename\":\"BookReviewsConnection\"}},\"errors\":[{\"path\":[\"getReviews\",\"edges\",0,\"node\",\"creator\",\"viewerRelationshipStatus\"],\"data\":null,\"errorType\":\"Unauthorized\",\"errorInfo\":null,\"locations\":[{\"line\":85,\"column\":3,\"sourceName\":null}],\"message\":\"Not
